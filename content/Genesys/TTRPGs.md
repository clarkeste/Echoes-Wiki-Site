TTRPG stands for Table-Top Roleplaying Game. Even though we’re not literally playing [[Echoes of the Departed]] on a Table-top, the meaning remains—a paper-and-pen, theatre of the mind-esque Roleplaying Game.

[[Genesys]] is the TTRPG system on which this game is built off of. Additionally, you may have heard of other TTRPGs, such as FATE, Call of Cthulhu, Pathfinder, and… what was the other one? Oh, yeah, Dungeons and Dragons.

In TTRPGs, you play a [[Character]] that interacts with a world, usually rolling [[Narrative Dice|Dice]] to determine if what they attempt to do succeeds or not. Genesys in particular expands on this concept, and attempts to intermarry the concept of storytelling and gameplay—which is why we are using it!
