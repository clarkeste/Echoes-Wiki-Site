Genesys, literally meaning ‘General System’, is the rules system that [[Echoes of the Departed]] is built on. It is unique in its use of the [[Narrative Dice]] system, which allows for a far more cinematic and story-based experience, which is why it was chosen for this game. Also, because I think it’s rad. 

Just the right amount of crunchiness, very flexible, but ultimately still focusing on the story. It’s the type of game that affirms to you that it’s a collaborative Story game, but isn’t so fuzzy that it makes you wonder why exactly it’s a game to begin with. That is my two cents, at least.

While many of the rules of Genesys have been modified, removed, or added, it is still beneficial to have read the [[Genesys Core Rulebook]]. Again, though, it’s not inherently necessary to play in [[Echoes of the Departed]].

Keep in mind the digital purchase link seems to be broken for some reason. Corporate incompetence, honestly; the game was sold to a new company called Edge Studio and now it’s under their name, and nobody bothered to update the link.
