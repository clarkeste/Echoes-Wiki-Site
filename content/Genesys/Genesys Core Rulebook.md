The [[Genesys|Genesys]] Core Rulebook is the base rules system which [[Echoes of the Departed]] uses in the game. To read more about it, check out the dedicated [[Genesys]] article; it’s really quite a robust system that can be used to do many different things, owing to its nature as a generic system.

If you would like to buy your own copy (which is not necessary to play in the Echoes of the Departed game), you have a few options. First, getting a physical copy—this can be through your provider of choice. Amazon, Walmart, direct from the Fantasy Flight Games website, etc. The second is a digital copy. The standard for most TTRPG digital copies is DrivthruRPG, and is usually considered them most reliable.

I would link it on Amazon too, but literally the physical version of most of the important Genesys products are out of stock. No joke, the only listing for the Rulebook is 70 Dollars (borderline scalper price) and is called “Sunny Face, Happy Face” (???). Also the Dice are just completely unavaliable haha.
