I’d like to thank some people that did really good work on this, and helped me overall with the settings, rules and website/overall getting things set up.

First, I’d like to thank my friend Cosmic_Clown_. He came up with many of the story concepts used and referenced in [[Echoes of the Departed]], like the [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Followers of Dragmire]] or the Pragmatist. He also helped majorly with the design of this website, particularly its color palette, and helped me playtest the game very early on.

I’d also like to thank [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0), who made [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), the software that turned this wiki from a series of notes in my Obsidian Vault into an intuitive website.

Following that, the software of Obsidian is truly amazing. Seriously, I was skeptical of most apps like it for nearly a decade, but Obsidian really clicked with me. It’s a great piece of software, and it’s where this Wiki was written and now edited.

I’d also like to mention Fantasy Flight Games (or Edge Studio? It’s confusing) for making and producing The [[Genesys]] RPG, along with all the designers, writers, playtesters, etc, who worked on the game. In my opinion, it’s the best generic system RPG there is, and its options truly feel limitless.

Finally, this Wiki uses artwork from various places on the internet, often by extremely smart, talented artists. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention them all.

I’d also like to thank, of course, [[RPGSessions]]—if I haven’t mentioned them enough already! Their website is extremely useful, and probably the best online resource for Genesys. Particularly, the people of the RPGSessions Discord Server, who were very helpful in talking with me about ideas or mechanical concepts. A few of the Talents in Echoes of the Departed are directly inspired by conversations I had with them, particularly Dallas, who is a developer for RPGSessions. They’re great people!
