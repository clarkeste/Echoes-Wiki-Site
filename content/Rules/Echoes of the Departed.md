Echoes of the Departed is this game, set in the Legend of Zelda world. It is a game set 400 years following the events of Ocarina of Time, and involve Hyrule in the throes of a Civil War—[[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Royalist against Follower]], Brother against brother, son against father, daughter against mother, wife against husband, friend against friend. 

One year ago, the Kingdom of Hyrule was embroiled in a climatic Revolution that lead to the death of King Hyrule--and his heir--as penance for the Royal Family's tyranny. At the head of the Revolution was a mysterious individual known only as the Confessor. Yet the fledgling democracy has its enemies both from within and from outside, not least of which a world that wishes slavery upon the belittled and abused once again.

Now, the Revolutionaries--known as the Followers--fight a civil war against the Royalists for control of the country. Yet, while this battle occurs, more malevolent forces, of neither man nor nature, plot the Kingdom's downfall from the shadows. It hides from sight, a festering anger that will not be quenched until all that wronged it burns in red flames.



The tone of Echoes of the Departed is similar to that of the Zelda games, particularly the more series ones.

Additionally, the game is largely open-world, allowing [[Player|Players]] to explore the war-torn Hyrule separated or together with other [[PC|PCs]]. They can ally with one another to strike at the core of the Followers or Royalists, or go into deep, ancient Dungeons alone. Additionally, Players are encouraged to have multiple [[Character|Characters]] so that they can be engaged in as many stories are they want, or can manage.
