Triumphs cause a spectacularly positive consequence or side-effect, that occurs regardless of the checkâ€™s [[Success]] or [[Failure]].

Triumphs are only found on [[Proficiency Dice]].

Its effects are many times that of an [[Advantage]] and can be used in ways that change the tides of an [[Encounter]]. A Triumph also adds one [[Success]]. This is automated by [[RPGSessions]].
