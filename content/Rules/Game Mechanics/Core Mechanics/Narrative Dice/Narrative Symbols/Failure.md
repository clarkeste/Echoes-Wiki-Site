Failures refer to the above symbol.

Failures cancel out [[Success|Successes]], and are generated by negative [[Narrative Dice|Dice]]. The canceling out is automated by [[RPGSessions]]. If a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]] does not succeed, Failures are likely to blame.

Failures are found on [[Difficulty Dice]], [[Challenge Dice]], and [[Setback Dice]].

The purpose of Failures is to make a check less likely to succeed. They have no additional effect.
