Threat represents negative consequences or side-effects that occur regardless of the checkâ€™s [[Success]] or [[Failure]]. The more Threat, the worse the effects will be.

Threat is found on [[Difficulty Dice]], [[Challenge Dice]], and [[Setback Dice]].

[[The GM]] chooses what will happen as a result of Threat, although they may ask the [[Player|Players]] what they want to happen if the Threat is generated by an [[Adversary|Enemy]]. Threats cancel out [[Advantage]]. This is automated by [[RPGSessions]].
