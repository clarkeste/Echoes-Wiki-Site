A Despair causes a severely negative and dangerous consequence or side-effect, that occurs regardless of the check’s [[Success]] or [[Failure]].

Despairs are only found on [[Challenge Dice]].

Its effects are many times that of a [[Threat]], and can be used in ways that change the tides of an encounter–for the worse. A Despair also adds one [[Failure]]. This is automated by [[RPGSessions]].

Despairs and [[Triumph|Triumphs]] do NOT cancel each other out.
