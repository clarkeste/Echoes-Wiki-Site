Successes are generated by positive [[Narrative Dice|Dice]], and determine if the core goal of a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]] is successful or not.

If at least one Success remains at the end of the check–determined by if the [[RPGSessions Bot]] displays it in the results section–then the Skill Check succeeds. If a check is Successful, its main effect and goal successfully occurs.

Successes are found on [[Ability Dice]], [[Proficiency Dice]], and [[Boost Dice]].

During an [[Attack Check]], each additional Success generates one additional [[Damage]].
