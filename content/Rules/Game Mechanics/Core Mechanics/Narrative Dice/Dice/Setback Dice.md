Setback Dice are negative dice, making it more challenging for you to succeed in a task. They represent a situational disadvantage. This can be your target hiding behind cover, unstable footing, interference, or any other number of possibilities.

When attempting a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], if the situation calls for a situational disadvantage against the [[Character]] making the Skill Check, the [[The GM|GM]] will add it as part of the [[Difficulty]].

In the [[RPGSessions Bot]]s, the commands to use this type of die are S or K, depending on if your settings are set to use the name of the die or the color respectively. (K is used for Black).
