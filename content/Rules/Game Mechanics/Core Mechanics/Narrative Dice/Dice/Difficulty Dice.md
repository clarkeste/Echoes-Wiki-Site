Difficulty Dice are negative dice, making it more challenging for you to succeed in a task. They represent the innate [[Difficulty]] of an action, and the possibility of failure at difficult tasks.

When attempting a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], the [[The GM|GM]] will tell you the [[Difficulty]], usually by saying something such as “2p” or “4p”; this refers to the amount of Difficulty Dice you should add. The GM may also sometimes say “c”, which refers to [[Challenge Dice]].

In the [[RPGSessions Bot]], the commands to use this type of die are D or P, depending on if your settings are set to use the name of the die or the color respectively.
