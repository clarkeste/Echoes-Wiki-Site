Ability Dice are positive [[Narrative Dice|Dice]], affording you a greater chance to succeed in a task. They represent affinity, and unrefined–but effective–skill.

Your positive [[Dice Pool]] is determined by which [[Skills|Skill]] you are rolling. The GM will often ask you roll a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], and set a [[Difficulty]]. Then, your [[Character Sheet]] will show the positive Dice Pool of the Skill you want to roll; that is the Dice you should roll, in addition to any negative Dice.

In the [[RPGSessions Bot]], the commands to use this type of die are A or G, depending on if your settings are set to use the name of the die or the color respectively.
