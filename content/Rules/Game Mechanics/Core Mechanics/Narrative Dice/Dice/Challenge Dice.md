Challenge Dice are negative dice, making it more challenging for you to succeed in a task. They represent a particularly daunting challenge posed by elite opponents, or a situation with the possibility to go very, very wrong.

Challenge Dice contain a unique symbol. This symbol, called the [[Despair]], causes an extremely grave hitch or complication as a result of your roll.

When attempting a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], the [[The GM|GM]] will tell you the [[Difficulty]], usually by saying something such as “2p” or “4p”; this refers to the amount of [[Difficulty Dice]] you should add. The GM may also sometimes say “c”, which refers to Challenge Dice.

In the [[RPGSessions Bot]], the commands to use this type of die are C or R, depending on if your settings are set to use the name of the die or the color respectively.
