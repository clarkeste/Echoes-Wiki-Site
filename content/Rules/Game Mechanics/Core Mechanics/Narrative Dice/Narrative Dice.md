The Narrative Dice system is at the core of [[Genesys]] and [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]]. It allows [[Skill Checks]] to have any number of permutations that can cause a single check to have many different results, side-effects, or tribulations.

In improvisation, there is the concept of the “Yes, but, or the “Yes, and”, or the “No, but”. The Narrative Dice system exists to facilitate this concept in the game, allowing a check to succeed with a drawback, or for it to fail but allow the active [[Character]] to still manage to squeeze some victory out of it.

In [[Echoes of the Departed]], there are six types of Dice. The first three are positive Dice, and the last three are negative Dice.
- [[Ability Dice]]
- [[Proficiency Dice]]
- [[Boost Dice]]
- [[Difficulty Dice]]
- [[Challenge Dice]]
- [[Setback Dice]]

In Echoes of the Departed, there are six Dice Symbols. These are the following:
- [[Success]]
- [[Failure]]
- [[Advantage]]
- [[Threat]]
- [[Triumph]]
- [[Despair]]

The last four allow for a check to have additional effects, good or bad, that occur regardless of whether the check was a failure of a success. This Narrative Dice causes there to be possibilities between failure and success–the many little nuances between victory and defeat, life and death, good and wrong.
#### Narrative Dice when Rolling
By default, the GM determines how Threat and Despair are spent, although in some cases (such as checks made by [[Adversary|Adversaries]] where [[The GM|the GM]] wishes to give [[Player|Players]] an option) he may give the players the option to spend these instead.

Remember that the following tables are only sets of ideas and examples. It exists solely to give individuals an idea of what effect each amount of Advantage could have, or be picked from if it’s the most logical, beneficial or the Players have no other ideas. These following four tables are collected from various parts of this wiki. Keep in mind that they all apply to one another, and what is in one could easily be used in another situation.

### Narrative Dice Reference Tables
Throughout this Wiki, there are several quick reference tables for examples of how Narrative Dice results can be used. It is suggested that you try to not take options directly from the sheet *too* often, and instead try to come up with ideas in the same vein.

These tables can be found in the [[Skill Checks]], [[Skill Challenges]], and [[Social Encounters]] articles.
