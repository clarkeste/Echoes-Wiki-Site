Difficulty refers to the Difficulty of a check. It refers to the base Difficulty, divorced from additional [[Challenge Dice]] or [[Setback Dice]].

Difficulty is determined in two main ways. The [[The GM|GM]] deciding when attempting [[Skill Checks]], and the [[Range Bands|Range]] between the [[Character]] and their target. The latter is used often in [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] and [[Spell Creation|Spellcraft]].

The GM will usually say Difficulty in two different ways. Either by saying “Roll a Formidable Check” and then mentioning additional Challenge Dice or Setback Dice, or by saying “Roll a ppp/3p Check”, and adding s or c to the letters. These letters should be copied into the [[RPGSessions Bot]] when making a roll, as each one corresponds to a dice (In this case, ‘p’ refers to Purple Dice, the command for Difficulty Dice. “3p” is another way of saying the same thing).

The following are the different base Difficulties, with helpful names to give you a general idea of how challenging each one would be.
