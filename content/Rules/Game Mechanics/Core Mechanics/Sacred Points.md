Sacred Points are a special resource that is shared by groups of [[Player|Players]]. Each Sacred Point can be used to increase the chances of a check’s Success, or otherwise benefit the player characters. Once a Sacred Point is used, it is ‘flipped’ and becomes a Malice Point which can be used by the [[The GM|GM]] on the behalf of [[Adversary|Adversaries]] to make the [[Encounter]] more challenging.

Sacred Points can be used to activate any weapon quality on a successful check. Additionally, it can be used to add things to the environment if the GM agrees and it is logical. It can also be used to gain a hint, or to [[Dice Upgrade|upgrade]] any check at all, including [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]].

Additionally, if a check generates no [[Success|Successes]] but additionally has no secondary symbol, such as [[Threat]], [[Advantage]], [[Triumph]], or [[Despair]], a Player may spend a Sacred Point to add a Triumph to the roll. The GM may also spend a point to add a Despair.

To use Sacred Points, navigate to the [[Game Table]] and look at the top-right of the screen.
