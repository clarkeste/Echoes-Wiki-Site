There are ways to make progress without a bladed edge. Whether that be through threats, lies, or simple kindness, it all falls into the category of Social Checks.

There is a more involved variation on Social Checks that tends to involve various different Checks to convince a difficult target. These are called [[Social Encounters]].

Social Checks are a type of [[Skill Checks]]. While Social Checks can be as simple as a check to convince someone of something, it can also be a series of checks, a [[Social Encounters|full-length Encounter]], in particularly solemn or vital situations. Additionally, not just [[NPCs]] can be the target of Social Checks–so can [[PC|PCs]]. However, PCs will never be forced to agree with, or do anything as a result of these checks. That said, if they go along with a successful NPC Social Check, they may mechanically benefit–and if they refuse, they may suffer drawbacks.

[[Social Skills]] may be called for by the [[The GM|GM]] in a Skill Check when attempting something in which success is in doubt, like with any other [[Skills|Skill]]. However, unlike with many other Skills, how exactly you articulate your persuasion, or how you go about it, can influence the check.

Different people may react to different [[Approach|Approaches]], even within the same skill. For example, attempting to convince a beggar with [[Charm]] by attempting to be empathic may do well with them, whereas flattery may not. Good Approaches can add up to 5 [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] to a check, and bad Approaches can add up to 5 [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] to a check. Knowing a [[Character|Character’s]] motivations, their biases, their desires, weaknesses, and what makes them tick, can add even more benefits to the roll. This means you should tailor your arguments to an individual. All of this also applies to full-length [[Social Encounters]].

Different Approaches can also influence the range of responses. Social Skills are not mind control; even completing the most difficult Charm check, even with large amounts of [[Advantage]], cannot convince a King to crown you. At most, he would very much enjoy the joke and offer you a profitable opportunity as the court clown.

It should be noted that some NPCs will use their own Skill to add negative [[Narrative Dice|Dice]] to the [[Dice Pool]], as opposed to it being a difficulty set by the GM, thereby making it an [[Opposed Check]].

#### Social Skills versus Players
While PCs can use Social Skills to convince, intimidate, or charm NPCs, the reverse is also true. In the world of Hyrule, there exist truly horrendous monsters that would chill one to the bone, and some of the silver-tongued orators that play on the basest of emotions. 

When an NPC attempts to use a Social Skill on a PC, they roll their Skill against the PC’s defending skill–this is often [[Discipline]], [[Cool]], or [[Vigilance]]. If the NPC fails, then their advances are rebuffed, the PC confident in the course they have chosen, or not letting themselves be unduly influenced.

However… What happens if the NPC is successful? It should be noted that, outside of extremely specific circumstances, NPCs can never force a PC to do anything with a successful Social Check. Even something as simple as shuffling a few inches over to make room. However, a successful check does always incur something onto a PC. The GM will describe how they feel intimidated by an NPC, or how they feel at ease near another. But, most importantly: they are presented with a carrot, or a stick.

‘Carrot’ refers to a benefit if the PC goes along. For example, going along with an individual’s charming advances for a long enough time after they succeeded a Charm check could give the PC a [[Strain]] bonus, as they enjoy their time with this affable person.

Going along may incur the following, depending on GM choice:
- Healing between 3-6 [[Strain]]
- Gaining a [[Boost Dice|Boost]] for the rest of the Encounter
- Gaining a free Maneuver, such as during a [[Leadership]] check  

‘Stick’, however, is the opposite; a penalty if the PC does not. For example, refusing the demand of a coercive individual may cause Strain as the PC feels frightened and unnerved by the threats, even if they remain steadfast on the outside. Or causing them Strain due to their thoughts drifting back to the likable person whom they turned down.

Refusing may incur the following, depending on GM choice:
- Suffering between 4-8 [[Strain]]
- Gaining a [[Setback Dice|Setback]] for the rest of the [[Encounter]]
- Losing parts of the turn economy, such as the free [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]], for a limited time

The GM chooses if the PC is faced with a carrot or a stick–although with enough Advantage, the check may present the player with both.
  
PCs cannot face NPCs with carrots or sticks, as a [[Success]] determines if they go along with it or not. However, NPCs will, as said previously, refuse anything unrealistic. A king will not exile himself, and a salesman wouldn’t give something away for free. Just as the king wants to maintain his power, a salesman has the reality of needing to feed his family.
