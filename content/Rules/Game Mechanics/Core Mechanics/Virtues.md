Virtues are the benefits gained from resolving [[Burdens and Backstory|Burdens]]. There are three Virtues–Courage, Wisdom, and Power. How a character resolves their Burden decides what Virtue they gain points in, decided by [[The GM]] and [[Player]] arbitrating which Virtue the solution to the Burden most aligned with. For example, solving a problem through violence would be aligned with Power, Wisdom would be aligned with solving an issue through clever thinking, while Courage would represent solving an issue through risky schemes–or doing the right thing, no matter how hard.

Due to the nature of these Virtues, sometimes a solution to a Burden might implicate a bonus to more than one Virtue. All Virtues have a limit of 6 Points.

### Courage
Bravery, or stupidity? That has been the question leveled at those who believe in Courage for eons. While tales are told of courageous heroes, many lie in graves, taken from the world far before their time. They lost everything they had—family, friends, lovers, property—to pursue what they thought was right. But they lie in their graves like any other common peasant.

The Virtue of Courage is considered to have solved an issue arising from a Burden when, no matter how hard, the right thing was done.
##### Courage Bonuses
Courage has a maximum value of six Points.

**Ability:** Flip two [[Sacred Points]] during a [[Combat]] [[Encounter]], and suffer any amount of [[Strain]].

They can used on any [[Skill Checks|Checks]]. that character makes during the Encounter, in any amount or order that the player wishes. At the end of the Combat Encounter, any unused Boosts are lost.

### Power
There is only one thing that is respected and feared universally, in every province of every nation. The influence of Power on society never varies; always, violence, threats of it, or authority over others has commanded the obedience of millions.

Using the Virtue of Power to address a Burden often involves fighting back directly in combat as a first resort or option, or using threats to gain what one wants. Additionally, using one’s station in a hierarchy to order others to address the situation, if possible, often falls under Power. While Power has traditionally been considered a virtue, most scholars now agree that using it as a first resort–or abusing it–is wrong. But that has not stopped hundreds upon thousands that have used this to great effect.
##### Power Bonuses
Power has a maximum value of six Points.

### Wisdom
While many dismiss its value, Wisdom is possibly the most important of the three attributes. The ability to examine a situation, to compromise, to solve it without bloodshed; these are the characteristics of one who is wise. And yet, such intelligence, just like any other attribute, can be used for ill.

A Burden is solved with the Virtue of Wisdom when a problem is solved with agreements, compromise, robust solutions, or otherwise dismantling the problem without the need to fight.

##### Wisdom Bonuses
Wisdom has a maximum value of six Points.
