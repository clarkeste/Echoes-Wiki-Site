Skill Checks are whenever your or another [[Character|Character]] does something in which its success could be in doubt. This could be lock-picking a door while [[Adversary|Bokoblins]] bear down on you, swinging your sword at an enemy combatant, or trying to jump across a gap, of which you cannot see the bottom.

Let’s say the PC is attempting to jump over a gap. After the PC describes their action, [[The GM|the GM]] tells them the [[Skills|Skill]] they must roll–in this case, [[Athletics]]–and the [[Difficulty]]. The Difficulty is the amount of [[Difficulty Dice]] in the Skill Check, and it is determined by how challenging something is, as judged by the GM. Further, the GM will tell the Player about [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] or [[Setback Dice]] they must deal with, depending on the circumstances.

Immediately prior to rolling, the [[Player]] may be able to use some abilities to increase the potency of their roll, such as spending a [[Sacred Points|Sacred Point]]. After this is done, the Player rolls their [[Dice Pool]], and the results of the symbols are decided. If the check ends with one or more uncanceled [[Success|Successes]], then the main goal of the check was a success. As for other symbols, the Player usually chooses what [[Triumph]] and [[Advantage]] are spent on, while the GM decides what [[Threat]] and [[Despair]] are used for. Extra uncanceled Successes, outside of particular situations like [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] do not confer any additional effect. Likewise, extra [[Failure|Failures]] almost never confer an additional effect.

And, after that, the GM or the Player–often depending on if it fails or succeeds–will narrate the effects of the check, such as heroically jumping over the cliff and landing into a roll, sword drawn.

It should be noted that [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] are a type of Skill Check that operates under unique rules when it coming to determining its difficulty. Something similar can be said for [[Social Checks]]. Additionally, there exists [[Opposed Check|Opposed Checks]] which are used in situations where the Difficulty is directly determined by another Character’s Skill, such as a contest of strength.

### Rolling on the Game Table
On the [[Game Table]], open the Dice Panel.

After it is open, you may input both the difficulty and you own positive [[Narrative Dice|Dice]] manually. However, if you wish to roll your Skill directly, you can do so. First, open your [[Character Sheet]] on the Game Table by clicking the icon of your character.

Then, select any Skill to roll. Here, [[Cool]] and [[Vigilance]] are highlighted as examples. Select a Skill by clicking on its [[Dice Pool]] icon.

Then, the Dice Pool will appear in the Dice Panel. Now, you only need to add the [[Difficulty]] as set by the GM, or additional modifiers such as Setback and Boost dice.
### Rolling on Discord
To roll on Discord using the [[RPGSessions Bot]], use .r command. For example: “.r (charm)ppp”. Replace ([[Charm|charm]]) with any [[Skills|Skill]] you want to use. The “ppp" afterwards is the difficulty, representing three [[Difficulty Dice]] otherwise known as Purple dice. You may also add Boosts to this field. 

Additionally, add a space after the “ppp” and insert text to add a description to the roll that will appear on the Game Table.

If you wish to change the naming scheme of the Dice–whether you use the color or name to roll the dice–navigate to your profile settings.

### Rolling and Results
Once you’ve assembled the Dice Pool, it’s time to roll. Hit the “Roll as” button to roll the dice, and let fate decide what happens next.

Once a dice pool is rolled, its results are displayed both on the right side of the screen in “History & Messages”, and the Dice channel on the Discord server. This is where the core of the [[Narrative Dice]] system comes into play–determining what the results of a roll mean.

While [[Success]] and [[Failure]] are simple to understand, other symbols–[[Advantage]] and [[Threat]], [[Triumph]] and [[Despair]]–represents additional side-benefits or complications in what is already a Success or Failure.

By default, the GM determines how Threat and Despair are spent, although in some cases (such as checks made by [[Adversary|Adversaries]] where the GM wishes to give Players an option) he may give the players the option to spend these instead.

Remember that the following table is only a set of ideas and examples. It exists solely to give individuals an idea of what effect each amount of Advantage could have, or be picked from if it’s the most logical, beneficial or the Players have no other ideas.
