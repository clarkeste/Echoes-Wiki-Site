The creation of Potions is an important discipline in many parts of the world; the ability to create elixirs that can heal, rejuvenate, or empower, is important for a myriad of reasons. Useful to soldiers, adventurers, night owls, and almost everybody else. Likely because of their usefulness, each one fetches a hefty price.

In light of that, many individuals make their living selling these Potions, or make them for personal use, or design entirely new ones. Making a Potion is similar to the [[Point-Buy Systems|Point-Buy System]] used in other Creation mechanics. 

How this works is that there are 3 Base Templates, which are [[Potion Template - Internal Potion|Internal Potion]], [[Potion Template - External Potion|External Potion]], and [[Potion Template - Meal|Meal]]. But, these [[Potion Creation#Base Types|Base Templates]] do nothing on their own; to gain an effect, you must change the Base Templates using [[Modifiers|Modifiers]].

All the Modifiers are listed in a section below. They include things like [[Burn (Modifier)|Burn]], [[Heal (Modifier)|Heal]], [[Accurate (Modifier)|Accurate]], [[Linked (Modifier)|Linked]], [[Disorient (Modifier)|Disorient]], etc. The idea is to pick a Base Template, and then pick a set of Modifiers–and test your Potion to discover its effects. That, or sell it to an unsuspecting person without testing it first. While the effects of some modifiers like Heal might be obvious, others–like Linked–may be less clear.

Each Modifier has an **Alchemy Point** cost associated with it. Every character, by default, has 4 Alchemy Points; each rank of [[Medicine|Medicine]], [[Knowledge - World|Knowledge: World]], or [[Culinary|Culinary]] adds an additional Alchemy Point. These Alchemy Points serve as the limit of how many Modifiers you can choose on any given Potion, as each Modifier has an Alchemy Point cost associated with it. Whenever purchasing an additional rank of a Modifier, charge the cost again. For example, purchasing Burn 2 will cost you 6 Alchemy Points, and Burn 3 will cost you 9.

A difference between Potion Creation and [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]], however, are the ingredients. Potions require physical Parts to be made, and often the difficulty of finding, or the cost of purchasing, these ingredients vary greatly depending on what Modifier they produce.

Which ingredients cause which Modifiers exactly is largely abstracted, so you will not have to worry about remembering what an apple does. However, keep in mind that some Modifiers–like Heal–may be more common and easier to find the parts for, than others–like Malice.

To use a Potion portably, one needs a glass [[Bottle|Bottle]] to reliably store the contents. Other containers can be used, but they have a myriad of flaws, and something such as wood may dull and weaken the effects of the Potion.

### Cauldron and Brewery
To actually create a Potion, you will need a work station. In alchemy, this usually refers to a **Cauldron**, and various other bits and bobs that can help with Potion creation–most of the time, included with a Cauldron.

While Potion-makers can attempt to make these elixirs in simple cooking equipment, or even over a fire, the results are often worse. The penalties get worse the more primitive a method–with a simple campfire being amongst the worst options.

Higher-quality Workstations can increase the amount of Alchemy Points available. While most commercially available ones will only add 2 or 3, some may add up to 8.

Penalties from bad work stations can include -2-8 to the creator’s Alchemy Points, [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] increases and upgrades, and [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]]. A decrease in Alchemy Points usually indicates a base limitation of the method, whereas increased Difficulty and Setbacks usually represent how challenging and unsuited something is for Potion-making, and the unfamiliarity with these subpar tools. [[Dice Upgrade|Upgrading]] the Difficulty, however, introduces the chance of [[Despair|Despair]]; implying that this particular method has a risk of going very wrong…

### Making the Check
Creating a Potion requires Hours of [[Downtime|Downtime]] equal to half of the Alchemy Points spent on it, rounding down. [[Advantage|Advantage]] or [[Threat|Threat]] may speed up or slow down the process respectively. Once that Downtime is up, it's time to make the [[Skill Checks|Check]].

For every four Alchemy Points spent on creating a Potion, add a [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Die]] to the Medicine check, with below 4 having no Difficulty. Attempting to make it faster, using damaged or subpar equipment, or working off of faulty documents, will add Setbacks; likewise, creating a particularly unstable Potion–or doing so in unsafe circumstances–and or making one that needs a truly delicate touch will result in [[Challenge Dice|Challenge Dice]].

But that’s not all! Additional Advantages or [[Triumph|Triumphs]] on the check can be used to add additional benefits, while Threats and [[Despair|Despairs]] can be used to add imperfections or side-effects to the Potion.

When crafting an item, may use Advantage to add more Modifiers; each Advantage counts as an Alchemy Point, a Triumph as four. Threat may add [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawback]]. Modifiers and Drawbacks added like this are maintained without additional Alchemy Point cost if turned into a Template.

If the Medicine or Culinary check is not successful and generates no [[Success|Successes]], then the creator either creates a ruined and unusable Potion, or one far below the specifications due to an error in the process. The process may be attempted again, but will cost the same Downtime it first took.

Once a Potion or Meal is made, you may make a Template from it by making an [[Operating|Operating]] check. If you made the Potion, it is a [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p) Check; if you did not, it is a [[Difficulty|Daunting]] (4p) Check. This makes the construction available for anyone else who attempts to make the Potion, or you in the future, and lessens the difficulty and Alchemy Point cost if it is remade exactly. It reduces the Difficulty by 1, the Alchemy Points by 2, and the Downtime by 25%; additional Successes will decrease the Alchemy Points by 1, while Triumphs and Advantage might decrease the Difficulty further or add [[Boost Dice|Boosts]], respectively. You may even find Templates for existing Potions and Meals on your journey! If you’re having trouble doing the Operating check, recruiting professional help could lower the difficulty to [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p) or even [[Difficulty|Easy]] (1p).

Potions expire after an hour, most of the time; however, some of the effects–like being sick or being knocked asleep–can last longer. Advantage, additionally, can increase the duration of a Potion.

### Mixing Potions
