Refers to the game mechanic used in [[Items|Item]], [[Potion Creation|Potion]], and [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]]. Not to be confused with the [[Modifiers (RPGSessions)|Modifiers system in RPGSessions]].

Most Modifiers are based on a [[Qualities|Quality]] of the same name, and add that ‘Quality’ to the final product.

Here are the Modifier lists, for each of the three [[Point-Buy Systems|Creation mechanics]].
- [[Spell Creation#Modifiers|Spell Modifiers]]
- [[Potion Creation#Modifiers|Potion Creation]]
- [[Item Creation#Modifiers|Item Creation]]

### Drawbacks
Drawbacks are a type of Modifier that, instead of costing points, reduce the amount of points needed to create the Spell or Item. They usually incur some disability or debuff on the final product to do this.

Potions do not have Drawbacks. This is because, sometimes, creating a negative effect is the explicit purpose of a Potion—like when one is creating a poison.
