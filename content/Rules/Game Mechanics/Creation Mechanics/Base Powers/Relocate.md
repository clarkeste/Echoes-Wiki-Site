Allows the player to teleport. At its base value, it is similar to teleportation used by the Yiga and some other groups of Sheikah. Its default [[Range Bands|Range]] is [[Short Range|Short]]. 

For most [[Character|Characters]] and objects, the [[Difficulty]] of a Relocate Spell is dependent on the [[Silhouette]] (size) of the thing that the character is trying to move.
- Silhouette 0: [[Difficulty|1p]]
- Silhouette 1: [[Difficulty|2p]]
- Silhouette 2: [[Difficulty|3p]] 
- Silhouette 3: [[Difficulty|4p]]

Anything bigger usually cannot be teleported. If grabbing an important and unwilling [[Adversary|Rival]] or [[Adversary|Nemesis]], as determined by the [[The GM|GM]], Difficulty is determined by the targetâ€™s [[Discipline]] or [[Resilience]]. This results in an [[Opposed Check]].
