Allows its user to see brief glimpses into the future, or past. When activated willingly, allows a user to sense fleeting facts about a person related to the [[Modifiers]], but little more. Otherwise, it is usually not activated willingly; Prophecy Spells put on the [[Character Sheet]] will instead be used occasionally when given a vision, with the composition of the Spell influencing what vision is given.

During a Vision, may make a [[Force]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] with difficulty decided by the [[The GM|GM]]. Success will allow the Caster to partially control what they see, as if they were a lucid dreamer. [[Advantage]] and [[Triumph]] will allow them to glean more details.
