This power allows the caster to give various buffs or benefits to targets of their choice, including themself or locations. Likewise, it can be used to curse individuals or locations, but the means of how this is done is not publicized. By default, uncanceled [[Success|Successes]] on an Endow [[Skill Checks|Check]] add an equal amount to the [[Soak]]. Its default [[Range Bands|Range]] is [[Engaged Range|Engaged]]. Its [[Difficulty]], if the recipient is willing, is determined by Range; if the target is not willing, it is an [[Opposed Check]] against their [[Discipline]].

Endow is often used on crops to protect them from disease, which has done much to increase food security throughout Hyrule and the world.
