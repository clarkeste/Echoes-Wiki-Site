Allows its user to communicate with others so long as they either share a telepathic link with them, they are within [[Range Bands|Range]], or the telepathy’s recipient is using an item imbued with the power to receive telepathic messages, such as Telepathy Tiles. 

Its default Range is [[Long Range|Long]]. If the intent is to do harm or the target is unwilling, the [[Difficulty]] is an [[Opposed Check]] against the target’s [[Discipline]] or [[Resilience]]. If it is not, the Difficulty is dependent on the Range. Long Range is [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p), [[Extreme Range]] is [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p), and [[Strategic Range]] is [[Difficulty|Daunting]] (4p). Anything below Long is [[Difficulty|Easy]] (1p). Further than Strategic is often impossible.
