Manipulate allows you to pick up and move objects/people with [[Silhouette]] limitations. Default [[Range Bands|Range]] is [[Short Range|Short]], and targets can only pulled as high as Short Range off the ground. [[Modifiers]] that increase the Range will also increase how high they can be moved, to a maximum of [[Long Range|Long]]. The Range of the Spell also determines how far away from the Spellcaster an object or person can be moved using Manipulate.

- Silhouette 0: [[Difficulty|1p]]
- Silhouette 1: [[Difficulty|2p]]
- Silhouette 2: [[Difficulty|3p]]
- Silhouette 3: [[Difficulty|4p]]
- Silhouette 4: [[Difficulty|5p]]

Anything bigger is often impossible. If grabbing an important [[Adversary|Rival]] or [[Adversary|Nemesis]], as determined by the [[The GM|GM]], [[Difficulty]] is determined by the targetâ€™s [[Discipline]] or [[Resilience]], whichever is higher, in an [[Opposed Check]]. Otherwise, [[Difficulty]] is determined by Range.

The Caster must spend a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] every turn to keep the targeted being in their Grip. This Maneuver can move the target, or simply keep them in place. When a character is under the effect of a Manipulate Spell, the target can still use [[Actions]] and Maneuvers, but cannot use the Move Maneuver, thereby making them stuck in place.

Picked up [[Items]] or [[Character|Characters]] suffer damage if thrown harshly, or if they have something thrown at them. The [[Damage]] is equal to their silhouette x5. Silhouette 0 deals 3 Damage. The Difficulty of throwing like this is determined by Range, using the same rules as regular Attack checks.
