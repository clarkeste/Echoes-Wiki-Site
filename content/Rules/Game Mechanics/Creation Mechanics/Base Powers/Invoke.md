The Invoke [[Spell Creation|Spell]] allows its user to create objects and shapes and then summon them into the world. [[Difficulty]] depends on the [[Silhouette]] of the object; the Base Power of Invoke creates simple objects, such as barriers or [[Items]]. Its default [[Range Bands|Range]] is [[Medium Range|Medium]]. [[Modifiers]] on Invoke tend to impact what is made with it.

- Silhouette 0: [[Difficulty|2p]]
- Silhouette 1: [[Difficulty|3p]]
- Silhouette 2: [[Difficulty|4p]]  
- Silhouette 3: [[Difficulty|5p]]

Creating anything bigger is usually impossible. Should the Caster lose concentration or fall [[Incapacitated|unconscious]], created objects will vanish.
