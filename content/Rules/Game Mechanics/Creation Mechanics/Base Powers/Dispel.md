To Dispel or remove a Spell effect cast by another [[Character]], may make an opposed check against the [[Force]] [[Dice Pool]] of the opposing Spellcaster. This can be used to stop someoneâ€™s [[Prophecy]]-fueled vision, cut off an attempt at [[Telepathy]], stop someone from keeping someone else in place with [[Manipulate]], removing an [[Endow|Endowment]], or many others. Its default [[Range Bands|Range]] is [[Short Range|Short]].

When the effect of a Spell is Dispelled, that Spell cannot be recast on the same target for another 2 Rounds.

Particularly powerful or sacred items may also be able to Dispel some forms of Magic.
