The default [[Range Bands|Range]] of Attack is [[Short Range]]. Base [[Damage]] is equal to the casterâ€™s [[Willpower]], plus their [[Force]]. The [[Critical Rating]] is 3 and can only be modified through [[Talents]]. A Spell using Attack uses the Attack check rules, such as [[Success|Successes]] adding additional Damage, and [[Difficulty]] determined by Range.
