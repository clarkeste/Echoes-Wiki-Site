Magic in [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]] a is often very soft and versatile; sorcerers with impressive power can do much with their skill, including a wide variety of different attacks or utilities.
  
To represent this Echoes of the Departed uses a system where you can make your very own Spells, allowing you to flex your creative muscles.

How this works is that there are 10 [[Spell Creation#Base Powers|Base Powers]], such as [[Attack Spell|Attack]], [[Telepathy|Telepathy]], or [[Manipulate|Manipulate]]. So long as you have a single rank of [[Force|Force]], you may cast using any of these Base Powers. However, that is not all–you can modify these Base Powers using [[Modifiers|Modifiers]].

All the Modifiers are listed below. They include things like [[Burn (Modifier)|Burn]], [[Ensnare (Modifier)|Ensnare]], [[Accurate (Modifier)|Accurate]], [[Linked (Modifier)|Linked]], [[Malice (Modifier)|Malice]], etc. The idea is to pick a Base Power, and then pick a set of Modifiers–and test your Spell to discover its effects. While what various Modifiers do to Attack may be obvious, they may not be as obvious for a Base Power like [[Prophecy|Prophecy]].

Each Modifier has a **Magic Point** cost associated with it. Every character, by default, has 4 Magic Points; each rank of [[Force|Force]], [[Knowledge - Legends|Knowledge: Legends]], or [[Discipline|Discipline]] adds an additional Magic Point. These Magic Points serve as the limit of how many Modifiers you can choose on any given Spell, as each Modifier has a Magic Point cost associated with it. Whenever purchasing an additional rank of a Modifier, charge the cost again. For example, purchasing Burn 2 will cost you 6 Magic Points, and Burn 3 will cost you 9.

You can have Spells equal to your [[Willpower|Willpower]] + 5 on your sheet at any given time. This means a sorcerer with Willpower 2 would be able to have 7 Spells on their [[Character Sheet|sheet]]. To change the Spells on your sheet, you need one hour of [[Downtime|Downtime]]. If you’re in a pinch and want to use a Spell that’s not on your sheet, you can do so, but must spend a [[Sacred Points|Sacred Point]] first. 


Here are the Base Powers–they form the foundation of your Spells! First step in making a Spell is to select a Base Power.

### Creating a Spell

#### Base Powers
- [[Attack Spell|Attack]]
- [[Manipulate]]
- [[Endow]]
- [[Life]]
- [[Relocate]]
- [[Telepathy]]
- [[Invoke]]
- [[Prophecy]]
- [[Dispel]]
- [[Enchantment]]

### Modifiers
Here are the Modifiers. After you select a Base Power, the next step is to select the Modifiers you want. Make sure the cost of all your Modifiers is equal to or below your Magic Points! If you go over, there is a section below detailing [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawbacks]]–it will add complications to the Spell, but will decrease its Magic Point cost.  

 If your spell is still over the limit and you would still like to cast it, you may flip a Sacred Point and suffer 1 [[Strain|Strain]] for every point your spell is over the maximum.

- [[Accurate (Modifier)|Accurate]] (2)
- [[Auto-Fire (Modifier)|Auto-Fire]] (5)
- [[Blast (Modifier)|Blast]] (1)
- [[Blast (Improved) (Modifier)|Blast - Improved]] (3)
- [[Blast (Supreme) (Modifier)|Blast - Supreme]] (7)
- [[Burn (Modifier)|Burn]] (3)
- [[Concussive (Modifier)|Concussive]] (5)
- [[Debilitate (Modifier)|Debilitate]] (5)
- [[Disorient (Modifier)|Disorient]] (1)
- [[Ensnare (Modifier)|Ensnare]] (2)
- [[Guided (Modifier)|Guided]] (6)
- [[Increase Power (Modifier)|Increase Power]] (3)
- [[Increase Range (Modifier)|Increase Range]] (4)
- [[Knockdown (Modifier)|Knockdown]] (1)
- [[Linked (Modifier)|Linked]] (2)
- [[Malice (Modifier)|Malice]] (6)

- [[Stun Damage (Modifier)|Stun Damage]] (1)
- [[Sunder (Modifier)|Sunder]] (3)
- [[Superior (Modifier)|Superior]] (4)
- [[Vicious (Modifier)|Vicious]] (4)

### Drawbacks
You may take the following Drawbacks to reduce the cost of your spell. If your spell is still over the limit and you would still like to cast it, you may flip a Sacred Point and suffer 1 Strain for every point your Spell is over the maximum.

- [[Decrease Power (Modifier)|Decrease Power]] (-3)
- [[Decrease Range (Modifier)|Decrease Range]] (-4)
- [[Inaccurate (Modifier)|Inaccurate]] (-2)
- [[Inferior (Modifier)|Inferior]] (-4)
- [[Limited Ammo (Modifier)|Limited Ammo]] (-4)
- [[Prepare (Modifier)|Prepare]] (-3)
- [[Slow-Firing (Modifier)|Slow-Firing]] (-2)

### The Last Step
After adding the Modifiers, you’re done! Just give it a catchy name, and put it on your sheet. If it acts similarly to a weapon, it’s advised you add it as a [[Weapons|Weapon]] that uses the Force skill; otherwise, just leave the name, Base Power, and Modifiers of the Spell in the notes section, and that is it!

## Long-Standing Powers, and Cooldown
Spells that last beyond a single check, such as Endow, Invoke Spells or some Relocate and Telepathy Spells, often spend numerous Rounds, hours, days, weeks, or even months activated if they are not Dispelled. The amount of Spells of this type that can be activated, however, are equal to the caster’s Willpower. A character with Willpower of 4 can only have 4 of these types of Spells Active at any given time. In addition, these Spells can be Dispelled using the Dispel Power. These Spells count as Spells on Cooldown and cannot be cast again until the original Spell is Dispelled, or Dismissed by the user with a Maneuver at any time.

Any type of spell that the Caster is blocked from using due to it activating the effects of Limited Ammo, Prepared, or Slow-Firing counts to this maximum, until it is usable once again. An Endow Spell with Slow-Firing would count twice–once for the long-standing effect, and once for the Cooldown of the Spell.

To recap: Both Spells that have no set end such as Endow or Invoke and Spells that have a drawback that would disable the Spell for a time like Prepare count as being on Active when being used or on Cooldown respectively. Only an amount of Spells equal to the Caster’s Willpower can be Active.  Any action that would make another Spell Active is not possible.

## Upgrading Force
One thing to note is that Force cannot be increased past Rank 2 unless your character has some sort of mentor. Whether that mentor is a person or an object, such as a large trove of books, is up to the GM and the Player to decide.

## Ahah! I’ve outsmarted you, GM!
So, if you’re sufficiently sneaky, you may have realized: the winning strategy would be to make every single Spell on your sheet have a high Slow-Firing, and then simply fire them all off in a Combat [[Encounter]]. However, that won’t work for a few reasons.

Every time you end a Combat Encounter with one or more Spells on Cooldown (ie, they have Slow-Firing and have not recharged) then you suffer Strain equal to the amount of minutes/Rounds that they would’ve needed to recharge. This means if you have Slow-Firing 6 on a Spell and use it at the very last Round, you would have to suffer 6 Strain at the end of the Encounter.

You can still attempt this strategy, of course, and it’s a valid way to push yourself and punch above your weight–just make sure it is not so taxing that your Character collapses and leaves themselves vulnerable.

This does all raise the point of, despite my attempts to balance everything added, there are likely things that are abusable. If you do decide to abuse them–which, I understand–just be prepared that if I decide it is unintentional, the strategy may be nerfed. If it is, the GM will offer the ability for you to re-specialize your Character Sheet at no cost.
