There are various Point-Buy Systems in [[Echoes of the Departed]], usually existing to allow a [[PC|PC]] to customize their abilities or creations. This includes [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]], [[Item Creation|Item Creation]], and [[Potion Creation|Potion Creation]].

These systems are similar in that they use Creation [[Modifiers|Modifiers]] (often named off of [[Qualities|Qualities]] with similar effects) combined with a [[Spell Creation#Base Powers|Base Power]] or [[Potion Creation#Base Types|Base]] [[Item Creation#Base Options|Template]] to create an entirely unique Item, Potion, or Spell.

Read more about each Point-Buy System in their corresponding documents.
