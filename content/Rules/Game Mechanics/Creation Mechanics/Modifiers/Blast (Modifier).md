Blast is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]], [[Spell Creation|Spell]], and [[Potion Creation]]. It is based off the [[Blast (Active) (Quality)|Blast Quality]].

### [[Spell Creation]]: Blast (1)
Active: Yes
Stacks: Yes
Limit: 14
Blast makes a Spell impact not just a target, but an entire area within [[Engaged Range]] of the original target. Whether or not it’s activated with [[Advantage|Advantages]] depends on the Spell itself.

In [[Attack Spell|Attack Spells]], if a check is successful and Blast is activated with 2 Advantages, each character Engaged with the original target–even if they are an ally–suffers [[Damage]] equal to the weapon's Blast rating.

May also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending 3 Advantages. If this happens, the original target suffers Blast damage as well.

### [[Potion Creation]]: Blast (6)
Rarity: Uncommon
Stacks: Yes
Limit: 2
Blast makes a Potion not just consumable via drinking, but also by proximity. These Potions are gaseous and can be absorbed by the skin, causing their effects to begin that way. If used internally, rumors are that the effects of the Potion can then spread physically.

### [[Item Creation]]: Blast (1)
Active: Yes
Stacks: Yes
Limit: 14
If the [[Attack Check|Attack]] is successful and Blast is activated with 2 advantages, each character [[Engaged Range|Engaged]] with the original target–even if they are an ally–suffers [[Damage]] equal to the [[Weapons|Weapon’s]] Blast rating.
