Flammable is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation]]. It is a [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawback]] that reduces the cost of an Item. It is based off the [[Flammable (Passive) (Quality)|Flammable]] Quality.

### [[Item Creation]]: Flammable (-2)
Active: No
Stacks: No
Limit: 1
Despite being primarily made of metal, some part of the Item–such as its shaft, core, or handle–is wooden, meaning that under the right conditions, this Item could burn.

Flammable cannot be selected if the [[Items|Item]] is entirely made out of wood, as it is already flammable by default.
