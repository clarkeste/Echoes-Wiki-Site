Burn is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]], [[Spell Creation|Spell]], and [[Potion Creation]]. It is based off the [[Burn (Active) (Quality)|Burn Quality]].

### [[Spell Creation]]: Burn (3)
Active: Yes
Stacks: Yes
Limit: None
Burn is often related to [[Fire]], or an effect that is spread out and repeated over multiple Rounds, like being set aflame. When used on a Spell, that Spell becomes fiery.

In a successful [[Attack Spell|Attack Spell]], may spend 2 [[Advantage|Advantages]] to use Burn on a target. A target afflicted with Burn continues to suffer the weapon's base [[Damage]] each Round for a number of Rounds equal to the Spell’s Burn rating. Damage is applied at the start of each of the target's turns.

As an [[Actions|Action]], a character suffering from Burn may make a [[Difficulty|2p]] [[Coordination]] check to put out the flames, although the [[Difficulty]] may vary. Water too will put out fire.

### [[Potion Creation]]: Burn (3)
Rarity: Rare
Stacks: Yes
Limit: 3
Burn in a Potion makes the user resistant to heat, with the amount of resistance increasing by the amount of Burn. Some also report using Burn with [[Potion Template - External Potion|External Potions]] for interesting results.

### [[Item Creation]]: Burn (3)
