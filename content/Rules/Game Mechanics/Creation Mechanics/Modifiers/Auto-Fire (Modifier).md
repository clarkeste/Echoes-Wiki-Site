Auto-Fire is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]], [[Spell Creation|Spell]], and [[Potion Creation|Potion Creation]]. It is based off the [[Auto-Fire (Active) (Quality)|Auto-Fire]] Quality.

### [[Spell Creation]]: Auto-Fire (5)
Active: Yes
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
Auto-Fire typically allows Spells to be used multiple times in the same [[Skill Checks|Check]] if enough [[Advantage]] is gained, either on the same target or different targets.

On an [[Attack Spell|Attack Spell]], may choose to Increase the [[Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check]] by one. If this is done, may trigger Auto-Fire by spending 2 [[Advantage|Advantages]] an unlimited number of times; each time Auto-Fire is triggered, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that Spell, and each hit deals base [[Damage]] plus the number of uncanceled [[Success|Successes]] on the check.

Additional hits can be allocated to the target, or to other targets within range of the Spell. Only targets that would’ve had an easier or identical check difficulty if directly targeted can be hit this way.

### [[Potion Creation]]: Auto-Fire (5)
Rarity: Uncommon
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
When initially drinking a Potion with Auto-Fire, nothing will happen. However, when a certain effect related to the purpose of the Potion happens, the effects of the Potion will auto-trigger. For example, a Potion with more [[Heal (Modifier)|Heal]] than any other [[Modifiers|Modifier]] will activate when the drinker goes over their [[Wound Threshold]]. These Potions only stay active for 12 hours.

### [[Item Creation]]: Auto-Fire (5)
Active: Yes
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
May choose to Increase the [[Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check]] by one. If successful, may trigger Auto-Fire by spending 2 [[Advantage|Advantages]] an unlimited number of times; each time Auto-Fire is triggered, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that [[Weapons|Weapon]], and each hit deals base [[Damage]] plus the number of uncanceled [[Success|Successes]] on the check.

Additional hits can be allocated to the target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. Only targets that would’ve had an easier or identical check [[Difficulty]] if directly targeted can be hit this way.
