Stun Damage is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]] and [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]]. It is based off the [[Stun Damage (Active) (Quality)|Stun Damage Quality]].

### [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]]: Stun Damage (1)
Active: Yes
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
As opposed to the regular [[Stun (Active) (Quality)|Stun Quality]] which interacts with [[Strain|Strain]] secondarily in addition to an attack interacting with [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]] and [[Wounds|Wounds]], Stun Damage instead makes the effects of the [[Spell Creation|Spell]] interact primarily with Strain, replacing Wounds.

On an [[Attack Spell|Attack Spell]], attacks will no longer deal regular [[Damage|Damage]]; instead, they deal Stun Damage that will lower Strain. Stun Damage, however, is still reduced by [[Soak|Soak]].

### [[Item Creation|Item Creation]]: Stun Damage
In Item Creation, unsharpened weapons by default do Stun Damage. As opposed to the regular [[Stun (Active) (Quality)|Stun Quality]] which interacts with [[Strain|Strain]] secondarily in addition to an attack interacting with [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]] and [[Wounds|Wounds]], Stun Damage instead makes the effects of the [[Weapons|Weapon]] interact primarily with Strain, replacing Wounds.

Unsharpened weapons, by default, have Stun Damage.

On an [[Attack Spell|Attack Spell]], attacks will no longer deal regular [[Damage|Damage]]; instead, they deal Stun Damage that will lower Strain. Stun Damage, however, is still reduced by [[Soak|Soak]].
