Accurate is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation]]. It is based off the [[Reinforced (Passive) (Quality)|Reinforced Quality]].

### [[Item Creation]]: Reinforced (6)
Active: No
Stacks: Yes
Limit: None
When an [[Items|Item]] is [[Reinforced (Passive) (Quality)|Reinforced]], it cannot be broken through common means, and is immune to [[Sunder (Active) (Quality)|Sunder]].

### [[Item Creation#Creating Armor|Armor Creation]]: Reinforced (14)
Active: No
Stacks: Yes
Limit: None
When a piece of [[Armor]] is Reinforced, the [[Character|wearer]]â€™s [[Soak]] becomes immune to [[Pierce (Passive) (Quality)|Pierce]] and [[Breach (Passive) (Quality)|Breach]], meaning those two [[Qualities]] will no longer bypass Soak.
