Special - Custom is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]] and [[Item Creation#Creating Armor|Armor Creation]]. It is based off the various Special [[Qualities|Qualities]] that some [[Weapons]] have.

### [[Item Creation|Item Creation]]: Special - Custom
The [[Player|Player]] and the [[The GM|GM]] can agree on a special ability for this [[Items|Item]] to have, and the resulting cost. An example is a Dagger which is easier to hide, or various heavy weapons which allow either the conditions of [[Unwieldy (Passive) (Quality)|Unwieldy]] or [[Cumbersome (Passive) (Quality)|Cumbersome]] to be met for its drawbacks to be ignored.
