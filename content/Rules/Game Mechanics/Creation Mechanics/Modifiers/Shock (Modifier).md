Shock is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item]], [[Spell Creation|Spell]], and [[Potion Creation|Potion Creation]]. It is based off the [[Shock (Active) (Quality)|Shock Quality]].

### [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]]: Shock (4)
Active: No
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
Shock is often related to electricity, and the ability to cause a surprising jolt, or the ability for the [[Spell Creation|Spell]] to be conducted through metal and water. When used on a Spell, that Spell becomes electrical.

On [[Attack Spell|Attack Spells]] that have the [[Shock (Active) (Quality)|Shock Quality]], the [[Character|user]] can spend three [[Advantage|Advantage]] to disarm an [[Adversary|enemy]] without sacrificing the [[Damage|Damage]] of the Attack, or needing a successful check. In addition, Shock will deal [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] to any other creature connected to the original target via anything made of metal, such as a floor, wall, chain, or any other object. Water will conduct Shock up to [[Short Range|Short Range]].

### [[Potion Creation|Potion Creation]]: Shock (4)
Rarity: Uncommon
Stacks: No
Limit: 1
Shock makes a [[Potion Creation|Potion]] electric. Physically, the liquid of the Potion will look a bit fizzy; after being drunk, however, the effects inside the body can be more severe, such as spasms in [[Potion Template - Internal Potion|Internal Potions]].

### [[Item Creation|Item Creation]]: Shock (4)
Active: No
Stacks: No (Singular)
Limit: 1
Rarity: Uncommon
After an [[Attack Check|Attack]] using a [[Weapons|Weapon]] that has the Shock Quality, the user can spend three [[Advantage|Advantage]] to disarm an enemy without sacrificing the [[Damage|Damage]] of the attack, or being a successful Check.

In addition, Shock will deal [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] to any other creature connected to the original target via anything made of metal, such as a floor, wall, chain, or any other object. Water will conduct Shock up to [[Short Range]].
