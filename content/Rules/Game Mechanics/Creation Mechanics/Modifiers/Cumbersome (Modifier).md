Cumbersome is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation]]. It is a Drawback that reduces the cost of an Item. It is not to be confused with the [[Cumbersome (Passive) (Quality)|Cumbersome Quality]].

### [[Item Creation]]: Cumbersome (-3)
Active: No
Stacks: Yes
Limit: None
To wield a [[Weapons|Weapon]] with Cumbersome properly, the character must have a [[Brawn|Brawn characteristic]] equal to or greater than the weapon's Cumbersome rating. For each point deficient, increase the [[Difficulty]] of all checks made while using the weapon by one.Â 

Cumbersome starts at 3. This means that purchasing the Cumbersome Drawback twice on an Item would leave the final item with the Cumbersome 4 [[Qualities|Quality]]. This can be reduced during the check with [[Advantage]].
