Unwieldy is a [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Item Creation|Item Creation]]. It is a [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawback]] that reduces the cost of an Item.

### [[Item Creation|Item Creation]]: Unwieldy (-4)
Active: No
Stacks: Yes
Limit: None
To wield a Unwieldy [[Weapons|Weapon]] properly, the character must have an [[Agility|Agility]] [[Characteristics|Characteristic]] equal to or greater than the Weapon's Unwieldy rating. For each point deficient, increase the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of all [[Attack Check|Checks]] made while using the weapon by one.Â 

Unwieldy starts at 3. This means that purchasing the Unwieldy [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawback]] twice on an Item would leave the final item with the Unwieldy 4 [[Qualities|Quality]]. This can be reduced during the check with [[Advantage|Advantage]].
