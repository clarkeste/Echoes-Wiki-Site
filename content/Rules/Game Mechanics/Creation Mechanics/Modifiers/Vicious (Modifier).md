Limit: 4
Vicious represents the ability to interact with [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]]–whether that be to cause them, or heal them.

When an [[Attack Spell|Attack Spell]] scores a Critical Injury, the [[Character|target]] adds ten times the Vicious rating to their Critical Injury roll. With Vicious 3, for example, the victim adds +30 to their [[Critical Hit|Critical Hit]] result.

### [[Potion Creation]]: Vicious (3)
Rarity: Uncommon
Stacks: Yes
Limit: 4
The Vicious Modifier usually indicates an unstable compound that–at least in [[Potion Template - Internal Potion|Internal Potions]]–can be dangerous to the drinker. Or, can infuse their body with so much adrenaline that the danger gets passed on anybody who is unluckily on the other side of the blade.

### [[Item Creation]]: Vicious (3)

Stacks: Yes
Limit: 4
When this [[Weapons|Weapon]] scores a [[Critical Injury|Critical Injury]], the [[Character|target]] adds ten times the Vicious rating to their Critical Injury roll. With Vicious 3, for example, the victim adds +30 to their [[Critical Hit|Critical Hit]] result.
