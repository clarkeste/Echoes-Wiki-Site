To see a simpler version of Item Creation that is used when constructing Items such as simple equipment or artwork, see [[Simple Item Creation]].

Craftsman and Blacksmith make various different things, specializing in different fields; toys, horseshoes, arrow-heads, replaceable parts–the options are endless, and can all be an excellent source of [[Rupees|income]]. However, one process is particularly complex, and sought-after in these times of Civil War: designing and forging [[Weapons]] and [[Armor]].

Because of that, many individuals make their living selling weapons, construct them for personal use, or design entirely new ones–either for their designs to be sold to the Guilds, or simply to make a one-of-a-kind sword. Making any of these more complex Items is similar in process to the Point-Buy System used in other [[Point-Buy Systems|Creation mechanics]], allowing you to flex your creative muscles.

How this works is that there are 6 [[Item Creation#Base Options|Base Templates]], such as [[Weapon Template - One-Handed Weapon|One-Handed Weapons]], [[Weapon template - Ranged Weapon|Ranged Weapons]], and [[Weapon Template - Pole-arm Weapon|Pole-arms]]. But, these Base Templates are just simple blueprints; to get a finished product, you must change the Base Templates using [[Modifiers|Modifiers]].

All the Modifiers are in the [[Item Creation#Creating a Weapon|Creating a Weapon]] section below. They include things like [[Burn (Active) (Quality)|Burn]], [[Concussive (Active) (Quality)|Concussive]], [[Accurate (Passive) (Quality)|Accurate]], [[Linked (Active) (Quality)|Linked]], [[Disorient (Active) (Quality)|Disorient]], etc. The idea is to pick a Base Template, then pick a set of Modifiers, and finally head to the forge to shape your weapon. What Modifiers you choose will change final product you create. How exactly the weapon operates given its parameters, is determined by the [[Player|Player]]’s narration, so long as is it justified and logical, as agreed upon with the [[The GM|GM]].

Each Modifier has a **Crafting Point** cost associated with it. Every character, by default, has 4 Crafting Points. Each rank of [[Craftsmanship|Craftsmanship]], [[Resilience|Resilience]], or [[Knowledge - Scholarship|Knowledge: Scholarship]] adds an additional Crafting Point. These Crafting Points serve as the limit of how many Modifiers you can put on any given Item, as each Modifier has a Crafting Point cost associated with it. Whenever purchasing an additional rank of a Modifier, charge the cost again. For example, purchasing Burn 2 will cost you 6 Crafting Points, and Burn 3 will cost you 9.

A difference between Item Creation and [[Spell Creation|Spell Creation]] are the **Parts** and supplies required by craftsmen. Items require physical Parts in their construction. This includes basic supplies that essentially all weapons need, such as wood and steel, as well as the rarer materials that certain Modifiers may require. These Parts are largely abstracted, so you will not have to worry about remembering what each one does.

Most Modifiers do not require any additional Parts; Accurate, for example, reflects on the finesse of the design and skill of the craftsman, whereas Concussive is more related to the purpose of the design and the blunt force it can exert. Neither would require additional materials. A Modifier like Burn, however, does require special Parts. For example, a Ruby or a suitable alternative would be needed to make a Firesword with Burn. Anything flies so long as you can logically explain or justify why the weapon has it and how it works, along with GM approval. 

### Workbench
To actually Craft an item, you will need some Smithy’s Tools. A portable version can be bought, but this will often incur a decrease in Crafting Points while working at it. A full-sized bench, such as those found in Workshops or Blacksmith establishments, will incur no debuff. Additionally, higher-quality Workstations can increase the amount of Crafting Points available, but this is rare.

### Making the Check
It takes Days of [[Downtime|Downtime]] equal to the Crafting Points used, to complete the weapon. [[Advantage|Advantage]] or [[Threat|Threat]] may speed up or slow down the process respectively. Once that Downtime is up, it's time to make the [[Skill Checks|Check]].

Making a wooden weapon decreases the Downtime of the check by half. However, wooden weapons gain [[Flammable (Passive) (Quality)|Flammable]] by default and cannot exceed 8 Crafting Points.

For every four Crafting Points spent on creating a weapon, add a [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Die]] to the Craftsmanship check, with below 4 having no [[Difficulty|Difficulty]]. Attempting to make it faster, using damaged or subpar equipment, or working off of faulty documents, will add [[Setback Dice|setbacks]]; likewise, creating a particularly unstable weapon, doing so in unsafe circumstances, or making one that needs a truly delicate touch will result in [[Challenge Dice]].

But that’s not all! Advantages or [[Triumph|Triumphs]] on the Check can be used to add additional benefits, while Threats and [[Despair|Despairs]] can be used to add imperfections in the design.

When crafting an Item, may use Advantage to add more Modifiers; each Advantage counts as a Crafting Point, a Triumph as four. Threat may add [[Modifiers#Drawbacks|Drawback]]. [[Increase Damage (Modifier)|Increased Damage]] is not available to be purchased with Advantage; instead, it is suggested to purchase [[Pierce (Modifier)|Pierce]]. Modifiers and Drawbacks added like this are maintained without additional Crafting Point cost if turned into a Template.

If the Craftsmanship check is not successful and generates no [[Success|Successes]], then the smith either creates a ruined and unusable weapon, or one far below the specifications due to an error in the smithy process. The process may be attempted again, but will cost the same Downtime it first took.

Once an item is made, you may make a Template from it by making an [[Operating|Operating]] check. If you made the weapon, it is a [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p) check; if you did not, it is a [[Difficulty|Daunting]] (4p) check. This makes the construction available for anyone else who attempts to make the weapon, or you in the future, and lessens the difficulty and Crafting Point cost if it is remade exactly. It reduces the Difficulty by 1, the Crafting Points by 2 and the Downtime by 25%; additional Successes will decrease the Crafting Points further, while Triumphs and Advantage might decrease the Difficulty further or add [[Boost Dice|Boosts]], respectively. You may even find Templates for existing weapons on your journey! If you’re having trouble doing the Operating check, recruiting professional help could lower the difficulty to [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p) or even [[Difficulty|Easy]] (1p).
