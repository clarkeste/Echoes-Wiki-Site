In [[Social Checks|Social Checks]], an Approach refers to an argument or conversational tactic use. Different Approaches work better or worse on different [[Character|Characters]] in different contexts, and can indicate various bonuses or [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]]–usually, up to five [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] or five Setbacks on the corresponding Social Check to convince a character of something.

While Approach are applicable in Social Checks, they are most important in [[Social Encounters|Social Encounters]].

After a Social Encounter has begun, the offending Character–usually a [[PC|PC]]–makes the first check. Each check in the Social Encounter must have a different Approach–this represents the different ways that a Character tries to convince a target. The same Approach can never be repeated. An Approach refers to a [[Skills|Skill]] in conjunction with an argument. For instance, if a PC were trying to convince the King to spare a criminal on death row, he could attempt to claim that the criminal was innocent. “Perhaps,” the King says. “But he has been sentenced.” The PC can now no longer claim that the criminal was innocent as an Approach. Instead, he must change gears to a different argument, or he must attempt to show the King why the sentencing was fraudulent, biased, or incorrect, thereby building on what he said. 

Good Approaches can be the difference between success and failure in tough Social Encounters. While natural [[Charm]] and likability goes a long, saying the right things is extremely important.
