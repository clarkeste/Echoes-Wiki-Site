An Opposed Check is when two [[Character|Characters]] do a [[Skill Checks|Check]] against each other, [[Skills|Skill]] against Skill. For example, if the two Characters ere trying to push each other off the platform, it would be an Opposed Check, with both characters using [[Athletics|Athletics]].

The opposer’s positive [[Dice Pool|Dice Pool]] is added to the check as negative [[Narrative Dice|Dice]]–[[Proficiency Dice|Proficiency]] becomes [[Challenge Dice|Challenge]], [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] becomes [[Ability Dice|Ability]], and [[Boost Dice|Boost]] becomes [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]]. This means that the difficulty is directly determined by the Skill of the opposer.

After the Dice Pool is constructed in this manner, the Check proceeds regularly.
