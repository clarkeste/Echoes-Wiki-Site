There are ways to make progress without a bladed edge, however. Whether that be through threats, lies, or simple kindness, it all falls into the category of Social Encounters.

While [[Social Checks|Social Checks]] can be as simple as a [[Skill Checks|Check]] to convince someone of something, a full-length Social Encounter is much more in-depth.

While most persuading will only require a single Check, some more important or in-depth negotiations may require a series of checks. This is similar to [[Skill Challenges|Skill Challenges]], but specifically tailored for a duel of wits, convincing someone of something particularly complex, poking holes in their beliefs, or otherwise an attempt to convince them that will take a long time. These are most often called Social Encounters, although they may also sometimes be referred to as Social Challenges or Social Combat.

#### Beginning a Social Encounter
The GM chooses when a Social Encounter is started. Beginning a Social Encounter is dependent on two things: It is something that is difficult to convince the target of, and therefore cannot be decided in a single Check; and, it is something they can indeed be affected by. Players cannot be the target of a Social Encounter.

However, as with regular Social Checks, there is still a range of possibilities, and the target will not necessarily believe anything even on success. However, even in the most mild of cases, it will represent a doubt or stress that eats at them.

Just like Skill Challenges, Social Encounters are won by getting an amount of [[Success|Successes]] equal to or above a number of Successes set by the [[The GM|GM]] at the beginning of the Social Encounter. This is determined by how resistant a certain character is to the idea being presented to them. If the resistance would cause over 50 Successes to the required number, then a Social Encounter is impossible. The number, naturally, can be anywhere from 5 to 50, but most will be no more than 15 or 20.

#### Engaging in a Social Encounter
After a Social Encounter has begun, the offending character–usually a [[PC|PC]]–makes the first check. Each Check must have a different [[Approach|Approach]]–this is the different way that a character tries to convince a target. The same Approach can never be repeated. An Approach refers to a [[Skills|Skill]] in conjunction with an argument. For instance, if a PC were trying to convince the King to spare a criminal on death row, he could attempt to claim that the criminal was innocent. “Perhaps,” the King says. “But he has been sentenced.” The PC can now no longer claim that the criminal was innocent as an Approach. Instead, he must change gears to a different argument, or he must attempt to show the King why the sentencing was fraudulent, biased, or incorrect, thereby building on what was previously said.

Using a different Skill is automatically a new Approach. Attempting to convince the King that the criminal was innocent using your oratory skills would be [[Charm|Charm]]; however, if you did it again, this time using [[Coercion|Coercion]] to tell him that the criminal was innocent, and once truth would come out his justice system would be tarnished, it would be a different Approach.

The [[Difficulty|Difficulty]], in every case, will be an [[Opposed Check|Opposed Check]]. This means the Difficulty will be equal to the target’s [[Cool|Cool]], [[Vigilance|Vigilance]], or [[Discipline|Discipline]], depending on the Skill used to convince them. Perhaps the King has a high Cool and is resistant to Charm, but his Vigilance is low–meaning he is likely to believe lies with sufficient proof.

Each new Approach can gain up to five [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] or five [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] depending on the quality of the argument made, with some more extreme bonuses or debuffs existing. For example, if the King cares little for the opinions of his people, convincing him that the reputation of his justice system would be tarnished by the false conviction would suffer Setbacks, as it is something he does not care much about. Likewise, appealing to his glory by telling him that he could put the judiciary in their place by overturning their conviction with solid evidence, would gain Boosts. Attempt to discover the weaknesses and strengths of a character, and what arguments do or do not work. Some Approaches, if entirely irrelevant, cannot be used.

In some cases, [[Knowledge Skills|Knowledge Skills]] may be usable, not just [[Social Skills|Social Skills]]. However, Knowledge Skills do not necessarily count as a new Approach.

There are some situations where an Approach makes logical sense or seems relevant, but–often due to information only the target has–is incapable of convincing them. In these situations, the Check will be allowed, but Successes gained will not count towards the goal.

#### Winning a Social Encounter
There are two victory states for a Social Encounter.
- The PCs reach the number of Successes needed to win the Social Encounter.
- The targeted [[NPCs|NPC]] goes over their [[Strain Threshold|Strain Threshold]].

#### Losing a Social Encounter
There are five failure states for a Social Encounter.
- The PCs have exhausted all viable Approaches that they know of, and have failed to adequately convince their target in those areas. Anything they say now would simply be repeating themselves.
- The PCs have greatly offended or frustrated their target, usually through a [[Despair|Despair]], and were not able to salvage the conversation. This naturally leads to the target no longer entertaining the conversation.
- The PCs suffer three Checks without any Successes in a row.
- Some Social Encounters have a time limit. If this is the case, and the time limit is reached before the PCs convince their target, the [[Encounter|Encounter]] is over.
- A participating PC goes over their [[Strain Threshold|Strain Threshold]].

Additionally, the target of the checks may–every three PC checks–counter with their own Approach to shut down the arguments of the PCs. They may use any of the same Skills as the PCs do, and Success causes one of the PCs to suffer [[Strain|Strain]] equal to the NPC’s [[Willpower|Willpower]], plus any uncanceled Successes on the check. Uncanceled Failures will cause the NPC Strain in turn.

#### The End of a Social Encounter
At the end of a Social Encounter, the PCs will either have successfully gained enough Successes to be victorious–thereby usually convincing the target–or they will have lost, due to the various possible failure states.

If they fail, the target will often be annoyed or adversarial, but no ill mechanical effects will befall the PCs aside from the loss of resources they used in the Encounter. However, should they succeed, the NPC’s opinion will either have been changed, influenced in such a way that will have consequences later, or they will suffer heavy debuffs in relevant situations as a result of the questions raised.

#### Strain and Narrative Dice
PCs can use Strain in various ways to give themselves benefits during a Social Encounter.

[[Advantage|Advantage]] and [[Threat|Threat]] can also influence the events of a Social Encounter. The following are simply ideas, and it is relevant to note that the results from previous [[Narrative Dice|Narrative Dice]] tables still apply; these are only additional concepts, as well as some previous ones that are even more relevant for Social Encounters.

#### Social Encounters against Groups
Social Encounters don’t have to just target one person–they can be against multiple people, or a crowd. Dealing with a crowd is very similar to the rules for dealing with a single person, except with more unpredictable Approaches.

Dealing with a smaller number, however, such as 2-3, is different. The amount of Successes required, in this case, represents different individuals combined. When enough Successes for one character is reached, they will often recuse themselves.
  
Some characters cannot be convinced of closely-held beliefs in a group and will need to be approached separately.
