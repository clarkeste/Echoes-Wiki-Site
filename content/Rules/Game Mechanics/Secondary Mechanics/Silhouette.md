[[Silhouette]] is how the size of an object or [[Character]] is determined in [[Echoes of the Departed]]. As opposed to getting lost by using exact measurements, the issue of how big a particular object, vehicle, or Character is, is instead abstracted into their Silhouette rating. The Silhouette Rating can vary from anywhere from 0 to 8, although higher numbers are rarer.

What follows is a description of what each Silhouette rating represents:
- Silhouette 0: Anything smaller than an adult [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Hylians|Hylian]]. Is used for children, or held [[Items|Items]], such as Swords or [[Shields|Shields]].
- Silhouette 1: Something about the size of an adult Hylian, such as a donkey. Most [[Character|Characters]] will fit smoothly into this range. About two meters in any direction.
- Silhouette 2: Larger beings, such as horses, Moblins, or [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Gorons|Gorons]]. About five meters in any direction.
- Silhouette 3: Vehicles, small boats, objects, or frightening [[Adversary|Adversaries]] of a significant size; A Carriage, Sailboat, or Hinox. About ten meters in any direction.
- Silhouette 4: A boat, or a particularly daunting animal like a Molduga. A Sloop, Schooner, or otherwise two-masted ship. About twenty meters in any direction.
- Silhouette 5: A smaller fighting ship, like a Brigantine or light frigate, or a small fortress. About forty meters in any direction.
- Silhouette 6: A Ship-of-the Line, large warships, Steam cruisers, or an absolutely titanic beast, about 80 meters in any given direction.
- Silhouette 7: Only the largest battleships, like Steelclads over a hundred meters long—like those produced by Holodrum—fit this category.
- Silhouette 8: What could possibly be this size? Why, it would have to be several hundred meters across at least….

A target’s Silhouette can impact the [[Attack Check]] [[Difficulty]]. When targeting a [[Character]] that is two Silhouette ratings higher than the active Character (ie, if a [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Hylians|Hylian]] is attacking a Hinox), the Difficulty is reduced by 1. For each Silhouette Point difference beyond 1, decrease the Difficulty 1, meaning that a [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Die]] is removed.

Likewise, when a [[Character]] is attacking a target that is 2 Silhouette Points *smaller* than them, the Difficulty is reduced by 1. The Difficulty decreases for each point beyond 2 that the Silhouette Point of the target is lower.

Additionally, in [[Ship Combat|Ship Combat]], Silhouette is the main way of determining [[Difficulty]], as opposed to [[Range Bands|Range]].
