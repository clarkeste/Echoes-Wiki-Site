Skill Challenges are for more complex, longer, nail-biting problems. For example, climbing a mountainside a kilometer into the air while [[Adversary|Bokoblins]] pepper the stones around you with arrows, or attempting to salvage a sinking boat and stopping the pirates from boarding.

During a Skill Challenge, the [[The GM|GM]] sets an amount of [[Success|Successes]] needed to win the [[Encounter|Encounter]]. This is usually between 15 and 30. The Players then make individual [[Attack Check|Checks]], with difficulty set by the [[The GM|GM]]. Any [[Skills|Skill]] can be used so long as the [[Player|Player]] can reasonably explain how their [[Character|Character]] uses the Skill in that situation to benefit their side. For example, in the climbing example, Skills such as [[Coordination|Coordination]] and [[Athletics|Athletics]] would be the obvious ones stated by the GM. However, a Player could easily make the argument that [[Ranged|Ranged]] would be applicable by narrating how their character picks loose rocks off the mountain-side, and throws them at the Bokoblins, or how [[Resilience|Resilience]] would be applicable by describing persevering despite their increasingly callused hands.

Players take turns rolling their checks. Usually, a Player cannot roll twice in a row, unless they are alone. Additionally, Players cannot roll the same Skill twice during an Encounter. Each Player can roll each Skill once. Once the amount of Successes required to win is reached, the Skill Challenge ends with a success for the [[PC|PCs]], with them completing–most of–their goals. However, just like how [[Advantage|Advantage]] and [[Triumph|Triumph]] can make things better, so can [[Threat|Threat]] and [[Despair|Despair]] make it worse.

It should be noted that the GM may choose–depending on the nature of the Skill Challenge, how many PCs there are, and various other factors–to allow the PCs to roll the same Skill more than once. This is rare, however.

Other factors in a Skill Challenge can pose great threats. When climbing the rockwall, perhaps the PCs are racing against the clock–having to reach the top before the Bokoblins at the top set up their explosives and blow the wall, sending the PCs sliding down. Time would be of the essence. Or perhaps each failed check results in the Bokoblins hitting a PC, dealing [[Damage|Damage]] or even a [[Critical Injury|Critical Injury]].

The Players may lose a Skill Challenge under the following conditions:
- Failing three [[Skill Checks|Skill Checks]]
- All PCs becoming [[Incapacitated|Incapacitated]]
- Being unable to reach certain conditions unique to the Skill Challenge, such as failing to reach and defuse a bomb in a certain number of Rounds.

In some rare cases, PCs may be able to undertake an action to reduce the amount of Failed Rolls currently in a Skill Challenge.

Skill Challenges can occur during [[Combat|Combat]]. For example, with the fixing a sinking ship while pirates board example–if the pirates already have their planks down and are boarding the ship with their swords drawn, a character may have to fight the Pirates while using some of their [[Actions|Actions]] to contribute to the Skill Challenge. And the Pirates might be able to lower the amount of Successes you have gained, if they aren’t interested in keeping your ship afloat…

#### Who Goes When?
Turns in Skill Challenges are played fairly loose. Essentially, anyone who wants to go–can. With a few exceptions. Nobody can go twice in a row, unless there are a low amount of PCs in the Skill Challenge. Additionally, any PC that has not gone in the last three turns benefits from two [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] on their next roll. This rule does not apply until the first two roles are finished. This is to encourage Players to participate in the Skill Challenge, as it benefits the whole group if they do.

If you’re worried about partaking in the Skill Challenge–don’t be! Even if none of your Skills look immediately applicable, it’s very likely at least one of them is. Ask another Player or the bot if you can’t figure out which one might be viable.

#### Narrative Dice in Skill Challenges
Other Narrative Dice examples absolutely still apply in Skill Challenges. These are simply additional ideas, with some tailor-made for Skill Challenges.
