There’s only one thing more valuable than [[Game Wiki/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/Rupees/Rupees|money]]–free time. If that time is spent having fun, accompanying your family, working on yourself, or… well, getting more money, is up to the individual.

Downtime represents these moments when the focus is away, and when the [[PC|PCs]] are not on adventures, allowing themselves to continue their life–mostly–normally. Just like Rupees, Downtime is something of a currency that can be spent on certain things–by a [[Character|Character]] deciding what to do with their Downtime. For example, a Character with Downtime might work their job to get Rupees, if that be foraging in the wilderness using the [[Survival]] [[Skills|Skill]], boring guard duty with the [[Vigilance]] Skill, or [[Item Creation|crafting]] new [[Weapons]] as a blacksmith with the [[Craftsmanship|Craftsmanship]] Skill. They might also spend it doing various off-screen activities, such as training, that grant bonuses, such as increased [[Experience Points]]. They may investigate leads from the main adventure, or, essentially anything the Player can imagine.

Downtime is broken into Weeks and Days. Each Week, as you may imagine, is 7 days. Each Month is exactly 4 Weeks, as each Month is 28 Days according to the [[Hylian Calendar|Hylian Calendar]]. The year consists of 14 Months, meaning each year is 392 Days, or 56 Weeks. However, looking at years and Months is excessive–what is often dealt with is Days and Weeks.

When the PC says a specific activity they would like to do–such as reading a [[Book|book]], going to train, brewing a [[Potion Creation|Potion]], or any other activity–the [[The GM|GM]] tells them how long this would take, usually in Weeks or Days. Then, as the Adventure is going on somewhere else–usually with a different character played by the same [[Player|Player]]–the Character experiencing Downtime continues their activity. They go along with whatever they want, along with spending ample leisure time.
  
They don’t have to, however. If the PC believes what they are doing is of vital importance, they can choose to push themselves. If they do so, the time to do something is cut by 25%--but their [[Strain|Strain]] is constantly half towards their [[Strain Threshold|Threshold]], meaning that if anything should happen on a moment's notice, they will be tired and less effective at dealing with the new issue. Narrative issues may arise, as well, from neglecting one’s work-life balance.

How much Rupees can be gained via Downtime is usually dependent on the job, just like how much XP gained from reading a Book, as well as how long it takes to read, is dependent on the item description. Additionally, some Downtime activities may require Rupees to pay for, such as tutoring. 

Something such as a job may require a [[Skill Checks|Check]] made to determine how good you did the job, with the [[Narrative Dice|Narrative Dice]] prescribing different possible results of your time working.
