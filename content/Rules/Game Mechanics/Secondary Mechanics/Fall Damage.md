Falling from different heights causes different amounts of [[Damage]].

- [[Engaged Range|Engaged Range]]: None.
- [[Short Range|Short Range]]: 5 Wounds and 5 Strain
- [[Medium Range|Medium Range]]: 10 Wounds and 10 Strain
- [[Long Range|Long Range]]: 20 Wounds, 20 Strain, and Critical Injury
- [[Extreme Range|Extreme Range]]: 40 Wounds, 40 Strain, +70 Critical Injury
- [[Strategic Range|Strategic Range]]: Instant death.

Intentionally jumping instead of following reduces the [[Range Bands|Range Band]] results by one, except for a fall from Strategic Range, which will always result in a death unless the ground is soft, water, or the character manages to grab onto something and break their fall.

When falling, may make a [[Coordination|Coordination]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] with no [[Difficulty|Difficulty]]. [[Wounds|Wound]] Damage suffered is reduced equal to [[Success|Successes]] on the check, and [[Strain|Strain]] Damage suffered is reduced equal to [[Advantage|Advantage]] on the check. A [[Triumph|Triumph]] may allow a character to redirect their fall. When falling from Strategic Range, this check will usually have a Difficulty and Success will mean that the character manages to grab onto something on their way down, saving themselves from certain death.
