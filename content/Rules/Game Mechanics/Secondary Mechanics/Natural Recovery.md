[[Strain|Strain]], [[Wounds|Wounds]], and sometimes even [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]] heal naturally over time. While it can be slow and unideal, it is useful in that it is the only way to heal without a [[Medicine|Check]], or an [[Items|Item]], such as a Healing [[Potion Creation|Potion]].

### Naturally Recovering Strain
Whenever a [[Character]] has a full and proper night of sleep, all [[Strain]] they previously suffered is healed, and their current Strain is reset to zero.

### Naturally Recovering Wounds
Sleeping for long enough, usually full night of sleep, heals 2 [[Wounds]], with each additional sleep healing another 2. Some things, such as [[Apothecary|Apothecary]] or proper equipment, can heal more—but it is seriously suggested that your [[Character]] see a medic if they’re suffering from any significant wounds.

### Naturally Recovering from Critical Injuries
[[Critical Injury]] are the hardest type of damage to recover from in [[Echoes of the Departed]]. After a full week of [[Downtime]] spent resting, a [[Character|Character]] may choose to attempt a [[Resilience]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] to heal a Critical Injury they are currently suffering from. While Success will heal the Injury—and additional Advantage or [[Triumph]] can heal other ailments—[[Threat|Threat]] or [[Despair|Despair]] can make a Character’s condition much worse, as their attempt to make use of the damaged parts of their body only cause themselves more damage.
