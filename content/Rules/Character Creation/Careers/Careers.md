Careers are what a [[Character|Character]] does in the [[Echoes of the Departed|Legend of Zelda]] world. They may be literal jobs (such as a character whose career is The Soldier and is a member of a military organization) or they may define your Character’s role in society and what the are good at (such as a The Socialite character, who could be a member of a noble house).

Careers are a list of 8 [[Skills|Skills]], usually thematically related in some way, that become [[Career Skills|Career Skills]]. 4 of the 8 Career Skills of your choosing gain an automatic Skill rank. Upgrading your Career Skills is cheaper than upgrading non-Career Skills.

In addition to picking a pre-made Career, you may also make your own easily! All Careers must have eight Skills, and must follow the guidelines below. These guidelines are so that a Character is not one-note or hyper-specialized, and still fun to play.

- Pick 4 [[General Skills|General Skills]], then...
- At least 1 [[Social Skills|Social]] OR [[Combat Skills|Combat Skill]]
- No more than 3 Combat Skills
- No more than 3 Social Skills 
- No more than 3 [[Knowledge Skills|Knowledge Skills]]
- No more than 6 General Skills in total.
- You can pick 8 Skills in total for your Career, then get a free rank in 4 of your choosing.

The [[Force|Force]] Skill, in this case, would likely be counted as a General or Combat Skill. While [[Spell Creation|Magic]] is very useful, it also takes great understanding to wield and can be a sink for [[Experience Points|Experience]]; make sure you are ready if you add it to your Career.

## Pre-made Careers
In addition to being able to make your own Careers, some example ones are listed here. These pre-made Careers serve to show what a Career looks like, and some possibilities. Feel free to use them whole-sale, or take one you like and edit a few Skills until it fits your character!
