Career Skills are [[Skills|Skills]] that your [[Character|Character]] is adept at, or is within their educational purview, and so cost less [[Experience Points|Experience Points]] to upgrade. 8 Skills become Career Skills at the start of the game, depending on which [[Careers|Career]] you pick. Later on, Career Skills can be acquired by purchasing certain [[Talents|Talents]].

Purchasing another rank in a Career Skill costs 5x the number it is being upgraded to. For example, purchasing Rank 3 in a Career Skill would cost 15XP.

For Non-Career Skills, it is the same, with one major difference. After the previous calculation is complete, add +5XP to the cost of upgrading a Non-Career Skill. This means that upgrading Non-Career Skills is more expensive than upgrading Career Skills. If a [[PC|PC]] intends to seriously invest in a Skill, it is suggested that they strive to make it a Career Skill first to reduce the overall cost.
