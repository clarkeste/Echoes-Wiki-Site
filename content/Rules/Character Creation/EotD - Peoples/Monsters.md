### Physical and Cultural Traits
Born of Malice, Monsters are endowed with power by their creators–usually some sort of malevolent energy or entity. Monsters can vary wildly in appearance, intelligence, tools, role, or any other way. Additionally, some of the more intelligent ones have shown the ability to act independently of their master. Or even disobey them.

Intelligent monsters, sometimes known as Demons, are a rarity, but not unheard of. Additionally, being powered by such cruel Malice is not always an innate trait. Ganondorf was a man before he transformed into the Demon King.

Their power seems to rise as anger and hatred among the world does. After the first Hyrulean Civil War, the power of monsters increased greatly. And yet, monsters were unorganized and of little efficacy without a force to guide them. Infamously, four hundred years ago, this was Ganondorf Dragmire, the Demon King. Using his malevolent powers, monsters as a society did not follow their own aimless wills as they had before–but a man, who was cunning and malicious.

In the last 300 years, their number has dwindled alongside the death of their master. But the rising anger of the revolutionaries and Royalists has foretold their return. Every day now, they appear in larger and larger numbers, their actions growing more coordinated with each passing day….
