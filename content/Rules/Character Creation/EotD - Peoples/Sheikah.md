### Physical and Cultural Traits
Sheikah are an ethnicity of humans. They share the long-ears of the [[Hylians]], but are distinct with their white hair. They have a higher than average chance of being born with red eyes. The Sheikah have always been a small group and secretive, for their own survival. Some take up a peaceful life, devoted to their work, while others become warriors in the shadows.

One thing remains consistent since the first Civil War divided the Sheikah. The world treats them with distrust and disdain. The world sees them--paradoxically--either as unloyal to the Kingdom, or the shadowy eyes of the monarchy.

### History
The Sheikah have long been allies of Hyrule, and have had a long history as warriors and survivors. During the first Civil War, most of them sided with the victorious King, acting as spies or secretive agents. Despite this, or because of it, the people of Hyrule--on all sides--viewed them with suspicion.

The remaining diaspora, reduced after the war and Dragmire's reign, spread out across Hyrule. Some stayed in their ancestral home of Kakariko Village, while others contributed in founding Kakariko City. And yet, the Sheikah were still treated with a quiet suspicion. Many hid their heritage, or pursued careers serving the Royal Family to prove their loyalty.

Yet even that door was closed off to them, six years ago. Suspicions emerged that the Sheikah were joining the [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Followers of Dragmire]]. With old conspiracies re-emerging, the King removed the majority of Sheikah from service. The King even removed elected Sheikah officials in Kakariko City, and Zelda's bodyguard.

Acts of hatred against the Sheikah began to increase. Many Sheikah felt alienated by the monarchy, as the King only stoked the bigotry. The Sheikah joined groups such as the Followers of Dragmire in response. When the Revolution began, they played their part.

Ever since then, Sheikah have been treated with disdain and outright hatred by many [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Royalists]]. While some loyal Sheikah still remain–those who hate the Followers for tarnishing the Sheikah's honor–the streets are rarely safe for those who do not carry a blade. Even in the cities of the Followers, intolerance still remains for those who are outed as Sheikah. The people of this culture are left with two choices. Live as true to one-self as one can in a world opposed to their existence... or embrace what Hyrule expects them to be: warriors of the shadows, ronin who deal in death and power.
