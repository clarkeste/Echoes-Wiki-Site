### Physical and Cultural Traits
The Gerudo are a human ethnicity characterized by above-average height and red hair. They're also genetically unable to produce sons, with only one boy born to their tribe every 100 years. Their names are in reverse order than the [[Hylians|Hylian]] usual, with their family name coming before their given name.

The Gerudo now fend for themselves in the barren wastes of the Desert of Doubt, alone. Despite this, their steel resolve has not withered. Likely due to the harsh conditions of their lives, the Gerudo value perseverance and survival.

The Gerudo once resided just outside the borders of Hyrule. They interacted with Hyruleans, forming relationships and lasting bonds. Yet, these bonds became undone when Gerudo Chief, Ganondorf Dragmire, betrayed and murdered the King. The Hero of the Time and the Sages sealed him away after seven long years, but the damage was done. The Gerudo, despite being unwilling pawns in Ganondorf's scheme, were now treated with suspicion.

One hundred years later, Dragmire miraculously returned and brought ruin. Few Gerudo chose to follow their old Chief, knowing what he had done. Yet, the Hyrulean Kingdom invaded after Dragmire was killed regardless. They set the Gerudo's settlements ablaze and pushed them deep into the desert, killing thousands in the process. Only when the Hylians exiled their enemies so deep into the desert that none would be seen again, did they cease the assault.

After their exile, Gerudo Tribe formed new settlements in the wastes. Despite the dangers of the Desert, they persevered the next 300 years through sheer will.

Their new King and his sister were born nearly three decades ago. The boy was adopted from the family who had him. The Chief, controversially, allowed the boy to keep his birth name of Ganondorf. Since then, Hylian extremists have been making incursions again in the Desert of Doubt, attempting to snatch them away. This led to the tragic death of Ganondorf’s own sister when he was but a young adult. 

In pursuit of resolution, revenge–and, perhaps, spiritual peace–Ganondorf left for Hyrule. His death months later at the hands of the revolutionaries echo the past sins of both the Hyruleans and the Gerudo. With Hyrule in flames as a result of its own civil war, it seems that the stage is set for the Gerudo to return to Hyrule. Whether that will be through an attempted peace, or fire and brimstone, is a decision for the Gerudo to make....
