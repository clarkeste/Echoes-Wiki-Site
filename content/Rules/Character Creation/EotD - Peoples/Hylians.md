### Physical and Cultural Traits
Hylians an ethnicity of human. Their primary difference from other ethnicities is their distinctive sharp-pointed ears. Legends say they have these to help them better hear the gods–but the difference, if any, is minimal.

As the main ethnicity of humans in Hyrule, the opinions and dispositions of Hylians vary. Hylians are the most common group in Hyrule, making up millions of the country’s population.

### History
The history of the Kingdom of Hyrule is long and storied. Yet, the further back one goes, the more its lore becomes muddled between recorded history and legends that are not verified. However, it is undeniable that Hyrule is among the oldest Kingdoms in the world. Its history spans at least several thousand years. While it began inside of the confines of modern-day Castle Town, it now encompasses the majority of the continent it exists on. Tribes such as the [[Zora|Zora]] and [[Gorons]] were incorporated, and considered core parts of Hyrule. Hylians have always been strong on the world stage, persevering through difficult trials.

But today, Hylians are as divided as their nation. Brother against brother, son against father, daughter against mother, wife against husband, friend against friend. Families divide themselves between [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Followers]] and [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Royalist]], between the new and the old. Some seek the comfort of the known and stable, while others dream of a better world. Yet, as the conflict grows more and more deadly, there is a question that remains: Who will win? And for whoever does… will there still be a Hyrule to rule over when the ashes settle?
