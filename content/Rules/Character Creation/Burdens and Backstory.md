While a [[Character|Character]]’s backstory might have only an indirect relationship with game mechanics, it is arguably the most important part of a Character–and your choices here can reverberate throughout the entire character. Backstories have very few limitations, so flex your creative writing! Keep in mind though that the [[The GM|GM]] will have to approve of your backstory, and that your backstory should be consistent with the world. A [[Player|Player]] cannot be a time-traveler who comes from the future and has a ray-gun.

As for Burdens, some examples and ideas are compiled below They are by no means an exhaustive list, and are only meant to give inspiration. Burdens can be anything, so long as it is dire enough, and a personal unresolved thread that could resurface. Additionally, many possible Burdens could fit one or more of the following examples. You do not need to slot your Burden into a “category”--simply have it listed in the Notes page of your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]] with details.

### Escape
You are pursued by something or someone. Either due to a bounty on your head, a traitorous rapport, information that could cause great harm to those behind the attempt to silence you, or an attempt to cut your destiny short by a phantom wreathed in otherworldly evil. No matter what you do, this cannot be escaped by conventional means; it is a dogged pursuit that will not end until you–or they–are dead.

### Seek
There is something you seek. The location of a loved one, a secret artifact, a sacred blessing that will cure you of disease, or documents that will prove your innocence in the eyes of the law. Often, this objective has fallen to the wayside in lieu of a clear way to progress, or the need to wait or complete other objectives first; however, it is still present in the character’s mind. All it would take is a new lead for the consuming search to begin anew.

### Obscure
This character is hiding a secret so large that discovery of it would threaten their very way of life. Perhaps they are one of the most famed sorcerers in Hyrule, but are using Malice and dark arts to secretly enhance their powers. Maybe their entire community has been captured by a cult; and as were they, until they changed their mind. Now they must hide their life apart and their newfound beliefs, or be executed. Or perhaps your character committed a murder of which they were never convicted; and the case has just been reopened.

### Prevent
Something will happen soon, an event that will be catastrophic to you and that you have a personal investment in stopping. The event coming about seems inevitable–the frontline approaching your village, dooming it to be burned in war. Yourself or a close friend or loved one succumbing to a disease, or a friend marked for death.

### Save
A close friend to the character has fallen to evil; either captured, or being corrupted by its influence. This individual must be rescued from the clutches of wrong. Liberation not only of a person is possible; perhaps an entire community has been swallowed by the clutches of evil or destruction.

### Destroy
Vengeance, righteousness, or some other motive has led to one inevitable conclusion: That another person’s life must be destroyed. A politician who abuses their station and whose carelessness has hurt you; a powerful commander that took everything from you, that you need revenge on. If the destruction is one of reputation, career, or life, is in your hands.

### Conflict
Multiple forces pull you in different directions, the strings taut. If any snap, there would be grave consequences for you and others. You must choose between separate forces pulling you in different ways; for example, your loyalty to an organization, but your own morality to not commit such evil deeds–or even, to prevent them from being done.

### Take
Your character is seeking to take a location, object, or person. Capturing an enemy leader on the orders of a dying General, or attempting to steal an artifact or object you have a great personal stake in, that could perhaps could save your life or that of another.

# Virtues
How you choose to resolve your own personal Burdens as they come up influences which [[Virtues|Virtue]], between Power, Wisdom, and Courage, is the strongest with your character. Please read about them and their effects on the [[Virtues|Virtue]] page.
