Encumbrance is the amount of weight, space, or general strain that the [[Items|Items]] a [[Character|Character]] is carrying represents.

The Encumbrance Threshold is by default 5 + the [[Brawn|Brawn]] of your Character, and additional items–like belts or backpacks– that increase your Encumbrance Threshold. Some [[Peoples|Peoples]]–notably, the [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Gorons|Gorons]]–may have a different default. The Gorons have 10 Encumbrance Threshold.

All Items that have an Encumbrance value add to your Encumbrance amount. [[Armor|Armor]], when worn, has its Encumbrance reduced by 3. This last bit is automated by [[RPGSessions|RPGSessions]].
## Penalties
For carrying more than you can hold, there are penalties. For each point above your Encumbrance Threshold, suffer an equal amount of [[Setback Dice|Setback Dice]] on all [[Skill Checks|Checks]].

When 1 point over your Encumbrance Threshold, you no longer gain a free [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] every turn.

When 4 points over your Encumbrance Threshold, every few minutes when in a stressing situation or every Round in [[Combat|Combat]], roll a d4. If the roll is a one, your Character [[Prone|falls over]] due to the weight.

When 5 points over your Encumbrance Threshold, add a [[Despair|Despair]] to every [[Brawn|Brawn]] or [[Agility|Agility]] Vheck.

When 6 points over your Encumbrance Threshold, you may not take Move Maneuvers in combat.
