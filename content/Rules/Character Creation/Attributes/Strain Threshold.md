The [[Strain Threshold|Strain Threshold]] represents how much physical and mental effort and exertion one can take before they begin to suffer ill-effects, such as falling unconscious, thereby being [[Incapacitated]]. Once a characterâ€™s current [[Strain|Strain]] becomes higher than their Strain Threshold, they fall unconscious. Notably, unlike with [[Wounds|Wounds]], a character going over their Strain Threshold does not cause a [[Critical Injury|Critical Injury]].

The Strain Threshold is determined by various things, such as [[Talents|Talents]] like [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Databases/Talents/Tier 1/Grit]], which [[Peoples|People]] a character is from, or their [[Willpower|Willpower]] rating.
