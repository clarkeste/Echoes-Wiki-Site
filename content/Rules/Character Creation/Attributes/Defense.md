Defense increases the chance to entirely avoid [[Damage|Damage]], by adding [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] to an opposing [[Attack Check|Attack Check]]. It represents things such as thick armor or strong shield that would cause blows to bounce off, or the ability to dodge or parry a blow with your own [[Weapons|Weapon]].

Ranged Defense will add Setbacks equal to Ranged Defense to all ranged Attacks; this means attacks from all Weapons that use the [[Ranged|Ranged]] [[Skills|Skill]], or Attacks from [[Short Range|Short Range]] or further.

Melee Defense will add Setbacks equal to Melee Defense rating to all melee Attacks; this means all attacks from a character within [[Engaged Range|Engaged Range]], unless the attack is using a Ranged Weapon.

Defense is gained from various sources, such as [[Talents|Talents]], [[Armor|Armor]] with a Defense rating, or [[Shields|Shields]] and Weapons with the [[Defensive (Modifier)|Defensive]] or [[Deflective (Modifier)|Deflective]] rating. It is an extremely useful statistic for avoiding Damage.
