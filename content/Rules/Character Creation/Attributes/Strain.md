Strain is the stamina system of [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]]. It represents physical exertion, mental exhaustion, and the tiredness both can inflict on the body.

Strain starts at zero. It has a [[Strain Threshold|Threshold]], which represents the amount of exertion one can take. If the current amount of Strain ever exceeds the Strain Threshold, the [[Character|Character]] will fall unconscious due to exhaustion, thereby being [[Incapacitated]]. The Strain Threshold is determined by various things, such as the [[Willpower|Willpower]] [[Characteristics|Characteristic]], the [[Peoples|People]] your character belongs to, and [[Talents|Talents]] such as [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Databases/Talents/Tier 1/Grit]].

To modify the amount of Strain you are suffering from, such as when you heal it or push yourself further, navigate to your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]].
