Wounds are the health system of [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]]. It represents physical wounds, injuries, and the overall worsening state of a [[Character|Character]]’s body.

Strain starts at zero. It has a [[Wound Threshold|Threshold]], which represents the amount of punishment one can take. If the current amount of Wounds ever exceeds the Wound Threshold, the [[Character|Character]] will fall unconscious due to the injuries and pain, thereby being [[Incapacitated]]. The Wound Threshold is determined by various things, such as the [[Brawn|Brawn]] [[Characteristics|Characteristic]], the [[Peoples|People]] your character belongs to, and [[Talents|Talents]] such as [[Toughened|Toughened]].

To modify the amount of Wounds you are suffering from, such as when you heal it or suffer [[Damage]], navigate to your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]].
