Total XP refers to the total amount of Experience Points your character has gained on their journey. **This does not include their Character Creation Experience.** Make sure to keep it updated, especially if you want to know how far your character has come!

Available XP refers to the amount of Experience Points you have available to spend. Make sure to keep this box updated as well so you know how much you have left when purchasing. When you reduce the Available XP box, make sure to add the spent XP to the Total XP box.
