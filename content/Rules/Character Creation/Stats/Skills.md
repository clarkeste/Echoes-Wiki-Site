Skills are the direct [[Dice Pool|Dice Pools]] that are rolled. Jumping over a fence while being pursued may use the Dice Pool for [[Athletics|Athletics]], for example, while [[Melee-Light|Melee-Light]] would be when using a sword to [[Attack Check|Attack]] a monster. These Skills can be upgraded directly. The [[Experience Points|Experience Points]] Price is 5x the rank you are purchasing. For example, buying Rank 1 of a Skill is 5 XP, Rank 2 is 10, Rank 3 is 15, et cetera. Skills can only be upgraded by one rank at a time, meaning you need to have purchased the previous rank. 

**Skills that are not [[Career Skills|Career Skills]] cost +5 Experience Points to upgrade in all cases**. This means that upgrading a Non-Career skill from Rank 2 to Rank 3 would cost 20 Experience Points, instead of the usual 15.

Skills are split into three categories–[[General Skills|General Skills]], [[Combat Skills|Combat Skills]], and [[Knowledge Skills|Knowledge Skills]]. Additionally, there is one Skill outside of any category, which is [[Force|Force]]. It acts as the Magic Skill.
