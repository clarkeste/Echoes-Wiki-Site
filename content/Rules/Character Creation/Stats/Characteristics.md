Characteristics are the overall affinities a [[Character|Character]] has, usually representing natural talents for a certain field. If the Character is strong, for example, they would have a high [[Brawn|Brawn]]; if they are particularly book smart, they may have a high [[Intellect|Intellect]], or high [[Cunning|Cunning]] if they know their way around stressful situations.

Upgrading a Characteristic costs x10 the number it is being upgraded to. Upgrading [[Agility|Agility]], for example, from 2 to 3 requires 30 [[Experience Points|Experience]], whereas 3 to 4 costs 40 Experience. Characteristics, like [[Skills|Skills]] can only be upgraded by one point at a time, meaning you need to have purchased the previous rank.

Characteristics are harder to upgrade after [[Character Creation Guide|Character Creation]], so it’s suggested that you spend as much of your starting Experience Point on them as possible. Look at what Skills you plan to use the most, and what Characteristics they’re tied to, so you can focus on the right Characteristics.

Characteristics, after Character Creation, cannot be upgraded in the way above. Instead, it can only be upgraded when the [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Databases/Talents/Tier 5/Dedication]] Talent is purchased.

The Characteristics are: 
- [[Brawn|Brawn]] 
- [[Agility|Agility]] 
- [[Intellect]]
- [[Cunning]]
- [[Willpower]]
- [[Presence|Presence]]
