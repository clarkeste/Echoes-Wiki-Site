Talents are special abilities or powers that your [[Character|Character]] has. These can range massively, from the ability to block [[Damage|Damage]] to a blow, to removing [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] from [[Skill Checks|Checks]] of a particular [[Skills|Skill]], to powerful abilities that let you deal additional Damage in [[Combat|Combat]], or execute particularly daring tactics.

Talents function on a tier system, with each tier costing 5 more [[Experience Points|Experience Points]] than the previous. Tier 1 Talents cost 5 Experience, Tier 2 Talents cost 10, Tier 3 cost 15, Tier 4 cost 20, with the maximum tier being Tier 5, which cost 25. You must have more Talents of the next lowest Tier to purchase a Talent on the next tier. For example, if you have five Tier 1 Talents, you may only have four Tier 2 Talents.
