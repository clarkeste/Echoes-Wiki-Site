[[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/Rupees/Rupees|Rupees]] have been the traditional currency of Hyrule for years, but their design is not the most convenient for storage and trade. Therefore, only a certain amount can comfortably be held on one’s person depending on the wallet size–the excess must be stored elsewhere on someone’s person, or in a bank or similar location.

To maximize the amount of Rupees that can be held, specially-made Rupee Wallets exist, which are very common and popular. These Wallets allow you to hold more Rupees without having every 30 Rupees increase your [[Encumbrance|Encumbrance]] by one.

Check them out at EotD - Store Full.
