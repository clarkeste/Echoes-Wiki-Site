Rupees are the main form of currency in Hyrule, and are considered an international currency. They are used in various locations due to their reliability and the influence of Hyrule as a country, making them easily spendable–even if they are, technically, annoying to carry compared to coinage.

Rupees, therefore, are the main currency of the [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]]. They can be used to purchase anything from supplies, to weapons, to lodgings and property. Rupees are usually gained through completing jobs, finding it in ruins, or other such activities that one would be expected to be paid for.

While there are other currencies in the world, Rupees are the primary one, with all other currencies being compared to it. While the stability of the Rupee has taken a hit due to the Civil War, it still holds an important role in international trade.

Here is the full [store of items that can be purchased](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1hvwJL_XvC9PeIaPHGaZWiC3Cd1IoqKs_B8Qg98Lk4s0/edit), with all prices in Rupees!

#### Rupees in the Bank, or in your Wallet?
Not all Rupees are stored on your person. Or, at least, they do not have to be. How many Rupees you can hold is dependent on the size of the [[Rupee Wallet|Rupee Wallet]] you have. While you can go over the limit, Rupees over the limit will cause [[Encumbrance|Encumbrance]] to be added to your character.

Any excess Rupees can be stored in the various banks across Hyrule, which can then be retrieved from those same locations. Rupees in the bank aren’t immediately usable, but do not add [[Encumbrance|Encumbrance]], and cannot be stolen unless the bank itself is bankrupted.

#### Adding Currency on Character Sheet
To edit the amount of Rupees you have, first navigate to your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]] on the [[Game Table|Game Table]].

Once there, scroll down at the newly appeared character sheet until you reach right below the “Weapons” section. Then, one of the boxes will say “Money”, or “Rupees”, depending on if my Coercion Check on the owners of [[RPGSessions|RPGSession]] worked.

Then, click on the box to edit and select the values.

It is suggested that at the bottom of the page, in the Notes section, you keep track of the amount of Rupees you have in the bank and on your person.

Additionally, if you are paid or are carrying money that is not in Rupees, list the amount in the Notes section. When you attempt to spend it or convert it into Rupees, the GM will tell you the exact current conversion rate between the two currencies.

#### Adding Currency on Discord
Use the “.c m +{amount}” command to add or remove money using the [[RPGSessions Bot|RPGSessions Discord bot]]. Simply change the {amount} field to be whichever number you are adding or subtracting. If you wish to subtract, change the + sign to a - sign. Make sure to remove the {brackets} when adding a number value.
