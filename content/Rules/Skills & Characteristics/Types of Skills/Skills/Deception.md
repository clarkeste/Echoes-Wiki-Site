This [[Social Skills|Social Skill]] judges the [[Character]]'s ability to maintain facades, and trick others into believing falsehoods. It is tied to [[Cunning|Cunning]].

It is used in rolls regarding:
- Getting another character to believe an untruth, or lie.
- Maintaining a facade or false identity that is under any scrutiny. After doing this once, it usually does not need to be done for each lie after in service of the facade for the rest of the encounter.
- In [[Combat|Combat]], causing an enemy to think you are the main threat and must be dealt with first, or causing them to think you’re a harmless bystander–until shown otherwise.
