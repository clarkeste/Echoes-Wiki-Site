This [[Social Skills|Social Skill]] is the [[Character|Character]]'s ability to command and lead a group of people, being firm and decisive. It is tied to [[Presence|Presence]].

It is used in rolls regarding:
- Rallying fearful allies, inspiring troops, being an excellent judge of character and skill when picking subordinates
- Convince a crowd of an ideal, such as a political movement
- In [[Combat|Combat]], provide bonuses for allies, or show enemies that you are the leader, leading them to attack you.

It should be noted that, despite [[Knowledge - Warfare|Knowledge: Warfare]] handling the tactical part, people who would have high Leadership are still excellent Generals. To use a historical example, George Washington is considered to have been a [mediocre general](https://www.washingtoncrossingpark.org/washingtons-strengths-weaknesses/#:~:text=Not%20So%20Much,planning%20as%20the%20fight%20unfolded.) when it came to tactics, planning, and strategy. [However, he was an excellent judge of character, surrounded himself with intelligent people, was trusted by his men, suffered with them, and listened to them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jt1ga6/was_gen_washington_a_tactically_good_general/) All of this was extremely important in his success.
