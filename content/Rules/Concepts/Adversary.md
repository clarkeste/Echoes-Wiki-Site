Adversaries, or Enemies, are combatants in [[Combat|Combat]] that oppose the [[PC|PCs]]. They are a type of [[NPCs|NPC]]; any NPC can be considered an Adversary if the situation conspires to pit them against a PC.

In Combat, there are three types of Adversaries.
### Minions
Minions are groups of enemies that act as one. For example, a single Bokoblin has a [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]] of 3. However, four Bokoblins together acting as a Minion group will have a Wound Threshold of 12. Each time a Minion group passes the max Wound Threshold of an individual member, one member of the Minion group dies, and the group thereby becomes weaker due to a loss of numbers. A [[Critical Injury|Critical Injury]] instantly kills a Minion. Minions do not have a [[Strain Threshold]]—instead, [[Strain|Strain]] suffered deals [[Wounds|Wounds]]. 

An [[Attack Check|Attack]] with [[Blast (Modifier)|Blast]] that activates with multiply its [[Damage|Damage]] by the amount of Minions in a group, as it hits each Adversary within that group.

### Rivals
A Rival is a individual enemy, who is strong enough and acts individually enough for it not to be a part of a minion group, but is not distinctive, unique, or strong enough to be a Nemesis. Rivals act similarly to Player Characters, except that they do not have a [[Strain Threshold|Strain Threshold]]. Almost everything that causes Strain inflicts Wounds on the Rival instead.

### Nemesis
Nemesis have statblocks identical to the PCs in most ways, including a Strain Threshold. Nemesis enemies are usually named and unique, or otherwise extremely dangerous warriors.

### Allies
Friendly NPCs also use the Minion, Rival, and Nemesis system—but there is no reason for Players to concern themselves about that, outside of a few rare cases.
