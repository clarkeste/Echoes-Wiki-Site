When a [[Character]] is Incapacitated, they become unable to take action, such as [[Maneuvers]], or almost anything else. When a Character is Incapacitated, they are usually unconscious, but not necessarily.

If a Character is over their [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]], they become Incapacitated. Likewise, if a Character is over their [[Strain Threshold]], they also become Incapacitated. Technically, a Character dying as a result of a [[Critical Injury]] is Incapacitatedâ€¦ permanently.
