An Encounter, or ‘scene’ refers to what it says on the tin: a scene in the story. Encounter is simply the fancy game-term for a scene, usually used to measure certain abilities as only working once in a given scene.

[[Combat|Combat]], or Combat Encounters, is usually counted as a single Encounter from when [[Initiative|Initiative]] is rolled to when the Combat ends, for mechanical purposes.
