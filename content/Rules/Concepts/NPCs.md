NPC stands for Non-Player Character, and refers to any [[Character|Character]] in [[Echoes of the Departed]] that is not being played by a [[Player|Player]]. Instead, almost all NPCs are played by [[The GM]].

NPCs can be as simple as mentioned individuals or characters with which a [[PC|PC]] has a quick chat with, or something as complex as a Character with their own simplified [[Character Sheet]] who can [[Adversary|face a PC down in battle]]â€”or be their ally in a time of need.
