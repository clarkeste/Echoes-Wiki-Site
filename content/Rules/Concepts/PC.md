PC stands for ‘Player Character’. It encompasses every [[Character|Character]] played by a [[Player|Player]]. All PCs require full [[Character Sheet|Character Sheets]], and must be created using the [[Character Creation Guide|Character Creation]] process. PCs, being the way that a Player interfaces with the world, are extremely important to [[Echoes of the Departed]]—and are, almost without exception, the protagonists of the story.
