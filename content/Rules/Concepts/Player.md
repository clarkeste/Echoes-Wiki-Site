A Player is an individual who plays a [[PC|PC]] in a game of [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]]. This term is usually used instead of PC when a Player is addressed out-of-character, separated from whatever [[Character]] they are currently playing.

### The Player is absent, but the Character is there
There will be some situations where a Character is present, but their Player is not. This can be during their turn in [[Combat]], while awaiting their opinion during decision-making or a conversation, or an out-of-turn situational [[Talents|Talent]], that would allow them to avoid [[Damage]].

While Echoes of the Departed takes various measures to try and make sure that one Player’s busyness doesn’t slow down other Players, a certain amount of it is unavoidable. Likewise, it is entirely unreasonable to expect for a Player to be online during all turns. 

For example, if a Character has the [[Dodge|Dodge Talent]], they have an option when attacked on the turn of another Character. They can use the Talent to increase their chance of avoiding Damage. However, it is clearly not reasonable to expect a Player to be there during the turn of an [[Adversary]].

In cases like that, it’s encouraged for a Player to say whether they want to use these powers or not during their turn. For instance, a Player with Dodge could say: “Also, if anybody attacks me, I’d like to use all my ranks in Dodge. But only for the first two [[Attack Check|attacks]]. I don’t think I have enough [[Strain]] to do it more than twice”.

Then, when the GM continues the Combat, they will make sure the first two Attacks have Dodge applied to them, and that future ones do not, until the Character’s next turn.

Of course, should a Player be online during the enemy’s turn, they may override or change any plans they set out earlier, or at any time prior, should they wish.
