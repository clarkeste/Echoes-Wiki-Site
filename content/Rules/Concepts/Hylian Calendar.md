Holidays:

Liberation Day
12th of Elda
This holiday celebrates the battle when the Hero of Time, the Sages, and the Princess Zelda of that era defeated the Demon King and ended his seven year reign, four hundred years ago. It is often marked by military parades, drinking, and partying. Most businesses give a day off.

Night of Creation
28th of Farorauru
This day takes place at the same of time of year, according to legends that are entirely unverifiable, as the creation of the world by the Golden Goddesses. It is usually a quieter holiday. Most businesses give a day off.

Spring Festival
20th of Nayre
The Spring Festival’s origins are in the Hyrulean Civil War, celebrating a major victory in it. The Spring Festival is often celebrated in cities by hosting, as the name would imply, a festival. It celebrates various rural and agrarian arts and crafts, as well as friendship. The Spring Festival is associated with innocence and new beginnings. Most businesses give a day off.

Hero's Day
11th of Timisi
Hero’s Day represents the gratitude towards various heroic people in Hyrule’s history, including–but not limited to–the Hero of Time and the Hero of the Flood. Various veterans or soldiers that did great things in the military are also celebrated this day. It is encouraged to give a friend a gift during this time to thank them for something ‘heroic’ they did for you. Businesses are mandated to give a day off.

Festival of the Flood (or Day of the Flood)
2nd of Asinober
The Festival of the Flood celebrates the day when the Hero of the Flood slew the Demon King and stopped the torrential downpour from sinking Hyrule. While there is an element of grimness, it is mostly a celebration of the survival and tenacity of the Kingdom, and is see as a far more ‘adult’ celebration. While individual cities have their own festivals, many will travel to the biggest one in Castle Town, organized by the Royal Family–where the current reigning monarch has given an address every single year on the day of the Flood. Businesses are mandated to give a day off.

Princess’s Day
24th of Yila
Princess’ Day commemorates the Princesses of Hyrule, who have long been important culturally, historically, and in ancient lore. Like the Festival of the Flood, the celebration for Princess’ Day is organized by the city government, and it is expected that the usually beloved Princess of Hyrule make an address. Last year’s was depressing, as the beloved Princess Zelda had been killed only a month before by the Revolutionaries. It marked many protests against them. Businesses are mandated to give a day off.

Hylara
7th of Naviran
Hylara, named after the Goddess Hylia, is a day that honors security and generosity. It is highly commercialized, with many companies and Guilds offering serious discounts to make buying presents for loved ones cheaper. Businesses are mandated to give the day off either on the day of, or the day after.

Winter Solstice
23rd of Naviran
The Winter Solstice takes place near the end of the year, and is used by the people of Hyrule to celebrate the year past, and look forward to the future. It takes place on the longest night of the year. Most businesses give a day off.
