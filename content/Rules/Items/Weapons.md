Weapons are [[Items|Items]] that are used to increase the [[Damage|Damage]], [[Range Bands|Range]], [[Critical Rating|Critical Rating]], or other such stats to make [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] more effective.

To use a Weapon, they need to be equipped. This usual takes one to both of your hands. One-handed Weapons can be used with another Weapon in the off-hand, such as a second sword, or a [[Shields|Shield]], while others are too heavy and require both arms to properly wield. Likewise, Weapons such as bows allow a character to attack far further than simply punching would usually allow.

There are seven main categories of weapon in [[Echoes of the Departed]].
- Light Weapons
- Shields
- Polearm Weapons
- Heavy Weapons
- Ranged Weapons
- Brawl Weapons
- Artillery
