An [R] next to the price tag of an [[Items|Item]] indicates that itâ€™s a highly regulated or entirely illegal. During [[Character Creation Guide|Character Creation]] or [[Downtime|Downtime]], purchasing a Restricted [[Weapons|Weapon]] might require [[The GM|GM]] approval, [[Skill Checks|Checks]], or the proper papers.

After the game begins, gaining a Restricted Item becomes a task that requires some involvement. This usually means searching for a black market, a particular buyer, or other potentially dangerous situations. While some Restricted Weapons might be sold at legal stores and be purchasable with the proper permits, most are not.
