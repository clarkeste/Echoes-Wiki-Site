Shields are a type of one-handed [[Weapons|Weapon]] that is often used in conjunction with another one-handed Weapon, with the Shield serving as defense. Therefore, a Shield usually has [[Qualities]] such as [[Deflective (Modifier)|Deflective]] or [[Defensive (Modifier)|Defensive]] so that a [[Character]] wielding it increases their [[Defense]].

They can be the difference between life and death in [[Combat]], and—if their Weapon of choice leaves them with a free hand—are a necessity for any Character serious about battle. Or, more accurately, serious about surviving one.
