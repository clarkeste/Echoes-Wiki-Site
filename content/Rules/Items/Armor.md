Armor is sturdy clothing worn with he purpose of protecting its wearer from [[Attack Check|attack]] and [[Damage|Damage]], usually by increasing the stats of [[Soak|Soak]] and [[Defense|Defense]].

Unless otherwise stated, only one suit of Armor can be worn at any given time. Armor increases Melee and Ranged Defense equal to its Defense rating, and increases Soak equal to its Soak rating, so long as the Armor is currently worn. While Armor can break, it will not do so under normal circumstances.

When worn, the [[Encumbrance|Encumbrance]] of Armor is reduced by 3. Armor may have other benefits listed as [[Qualities|Qualities]] on their stat-blocks, making each option unique.
