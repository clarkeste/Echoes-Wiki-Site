Different [[Weapons|Weapons]] have different Affiliations. Weapons with a certain Affiliation can only be purchased at [[Character Creation Guide|Character Creation]] if the [[Character|Character]] doing the purchasing is related to that Affiliation, as determined by the [[The GM|GM]]. 

After Character Creation, any Weapon can be obtained; however, Weapons that are aligned with a Character’s Affiliation are usually easier to find.

## None
This means that the Weapon is not particularly regulated by its vendors, and they do not discriminate on who they sell it to.

## Neutral
This means that the vendors of this Weapon have clarified that this weapon is meant solely for self-defense, and is not meant to be used by any individuals in the Civil War. Doing so on a large scale might invite sanctions from the vendors.

## [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Follower]]
A Weapon produced for and or by the Revolutionary forces. Due to this, members of the citizenry or Royalist faction who wield these weapons are rare.

## [[Gerudo|Gerudo]]
A Weapon produced for and or by the Gerudo people. Due to their forced isolation from Hyrule, these weapons are extremely uncommon outside of the few Gerudo settlements.

## [[Game Wiki/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Gorons|Goron]]
A weapon produced for and or by the Gorons of Death Mountain. Their peaceful nature and neutral stance in the war means most of their weapons are not to be used by either side; however, older weapon types whose blueprints long ago leaked, like the Giant’s Knife, are so widely sold that Goron City does not bother attempting to track them.

## Rito
A weapon produced for and or by the Rito of northern Holodrum. This bird-like species is known for its immense quality in bows. Due to Holodrum’s nominally neutral status, Rito weapons too are nominally ‘neutral’.

## [[Should my character believe in the Royalists, or the Followers?|Royalist]]
A weapon produced for and or by the Royalist forces. Due to this, members of the citizenry or the Follower faction who wield these weapons are rare.

## [[Game Wiki/Game Wiki/Rules/Character Creation/EotD - Peoples/Sheikah|Sheikah]]
A weapon produced for and or by the Sheikah. This mysterious tribe is well known for their affinity for weapons. Due to having little centralized leadership, many Sheikah weapons are sold to anyone who would appreciate them–although some modern Sheikah smiths have worked for the Followers exclusively.

## [[Zora|Zora]]
A weapon produced for and or by the [[Zora|Zora]]. These water-loving people are peaceful, but often aligned with the Followers. Few others can replicate their craftsmanship.
