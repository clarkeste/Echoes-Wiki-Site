The right tools for the job are important for anyone. While it might not be as flashy as a bladed edge, a rope or lock-pick can come in just as handy at the most crucial times and allow a [[PC|PC]] to save the day.

Gear and Equipment is a category of [[Items|Item]] that encompasses everything that is not a [[Weapons|Weapon]], or clothing/[[Armor|Armor]]. Everything from [[Potion Creation|Potions]], to traveling equipment, to light sources, to specialized tools, exist as Gear and Equipment.

The effects of a piece of Equipment is usually listed in their stat-block in plain text, and varies wildly, as the use cases for different pieces of Equipment are massive. The most consistent states are Price and [[Encumbrance|Encumbrance]].
