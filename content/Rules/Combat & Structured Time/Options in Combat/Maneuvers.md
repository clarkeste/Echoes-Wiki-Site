Maneuvers are the core of tactics and strategy in [[Combat|Combat]]. While you gain one Maneuver for free every turn, you may get a second by exchanging your [[Actions|Action]] for a Maneuver, by suffering 2 [[Strain|Strain]] to gain a second Maneuver, or by spending 2 [[Advantage|Advantage]] on a [[Skill Checks|Check]] to gain a second Maneuver. The maximum amount of Maneuvers per turn is 2. They, along with Actions and [[Incidentals|Incidentals]], are the things a [[Character|Character]] can do during Combat.

The following are things that can commonly be done with Maneuvers.
### Move
Moving is the most common type of Maneuver. Either by horseback or by one’s own legs, it allows individuals to move to new places.
1 maneuver = moving within Short Range
1 maneuver = From [[Engaged Range|Engaged]] to [[Short Range|Short]], or vice versa
1 maneuver = From [[Short Range|Short]] to [[Medium Range|Medium]], or vice versa
2 maneuvers = From [[Medium Range|Medium]] to [[Long Range|Long]], or vice versa
2 maneuvers = From [[Long Range|Long]] to [[Extreme Range|Extreme]], or vice versa

### Target
Also known as Aim, Target requires an [[Adversary|adversary]] to aim at. Each Maneuver spent Targeting adds a [[Boost Dice|Boost die]] to an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]] on the target, with a maximum of two. The bonus wears off after two turns if not taken advantage of.

### Called Shot
Spending one Maneuver to aim to target a specific Item or appendage on the target gives 2 [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] to the [[Attack Check]], lowered to 1 if two Maneuvers are spent on Called Shot. [[Success|Success]] results in that particular spot being hit, such as hitting a person’s hand, thereby causing them to drop their weapon, or loosing an arrow at the eye of a daunting Hinox and causing it to stumble.

### Stow, Grab, Use
Grabbing an [[Items|Item]] off the ground or from a belt, storing something picked up, or drinking a hearty [[Potion Creation|Potion]]. A [[Character|Character]] drinking a Potion in their pocket, for instance, would require two Maneuvers: One to grab it, and one to drink it.

### Go Prone, Get up
When [[Prone|Prone]], either knocked so by an [[Attack Check|Attack]] or due to a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]], all Ranged attacks targeting the prone character gain a [[Setback Dice|Setback]], and all Melee Attacks gain a [[Boost Dice|Boost]]. Likewise, leaving this position is another [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]].

### Shove
If in [[Engaged Range|Engaged Range]] of a target, may take the Shove Maneuver. The [[Character|Character]] taking the action pushes or otherwise forces a character into moving backwards, into [[Short Range|Short Range]] of the shoving character.

### Guarded Stance
May spend a Maneuver to take a Guarded Stance; all [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] targeting the [[Character|Character]] using Guarded Stance add a [[Setback Dice|Setback]] until the beginning of the Character’s next turn.

### Assist
A [[Character|Character]] may use a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] to help an ally; for example, by helping to steady their bow, or handing them the tools needed to repair a boat. Often adds a [[Boost Dice|Boost]] to the check, but may sometimes add more if the help is particularly skilled.

### Simple Interaction
Interactions that are too minor to warrant an [[Actions|Action]], such as opening a door, or jumping over a gap. 

While most  of these Simple Interactions do not require [[Skill Checks|Checks]], some–such as the aforementioned jumping over a gap–would likely require an [[Athletics|Athletics]] or [[Coordination|Coordination]] Check. If the cause of the check is not the [[PC|PC]] attempting something, but instead a momentary obstacle they can choose to interact with in a way that requires a [[Skill Checks|Check]], it will almost always count as a Maneuver, not an [[Actions|Action]], unless stated otherwise.
