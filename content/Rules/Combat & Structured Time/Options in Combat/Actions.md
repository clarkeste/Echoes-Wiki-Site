A variety of things can be done with Actions in [[Combat|structured time]]. Each turn, a [[Character|Character]] gains only one Action. There are almost no ways to get an additional Action. In addition to an Action each turn, Characters gain a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] each turn, the possibility of gaining a second. Additionally, Characters gain an infinite amount of [[Incidentals|Incidentals]].

Actions represent most things in [[Combat|Combat]] that take a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]]. Despite their rarity, they are undeniably what propels a Combat forward. The following are the sorts of things most commonly done with Actions.
### Attack
[[Attack Check|Attacking]] is the core part of Combat, as one may expect. Attacking is as simple as determining your target, determining the [[Range Bands|Range Band]] they are in, adding [[Boost Dice|Boosts]] and [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] from things like [[Cover|Cover]] or [[Moving Target|Moving Target]], choosing what [[Weapons|Weapon]] to use, and hitting ‘roll’. Everything else is auto-calculated.

[[Success|Successes]] add to [[Damage#Base Damage#Base Damage#Base Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]], and [[Advantage|Advantages]] and [[Triumph|Triumphs]] can be spent on secondary, narrative effects like in all checks, or to activate Weapon [[Qualities|Qualities]]. For example, perhaps when [[Brawl|brawling]] with a Bokoblin, your character knocks the monster towards the edge, leaving him clinging to dear life.

### Complex Interaction
Complex Interactions are when a [[Character]] attempts to do something challenging enough to require a [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], besides [[Attack Check|Attacking]]. Things such as lock-picking a door, pickpocketing an opponent’s dagger, or trying to unhinge a door from the wall to throw it, are all Complex Actions that take an [[Actions|Action]] and a [[Skill Checks|Check]] to complete.

### Cast Spell
Casting a [[Spell Creation|Spell]] is the main way that sorcerers and others who use Magic interact with the world. To Cast a Spell, pick one of the active Spells on your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]]; if you wish to Cast one that is not on the sheet, you will have to spend a [[Sacred Points|Sacred Point]]. Depending then, on the type of Spell, the difficulty will vary; but [[Attack Spell|Attack Spells]] or Spells designed to do [[Damage|Damage]] will use the usual Attack rules.
