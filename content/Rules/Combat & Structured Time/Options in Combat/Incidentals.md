Incidentals, as the name implies, are minor actions that, while they have their utility, have a greatly reduced effect on combat. Unlike [[Maneuvers|Maneuvers]] or [[Actions|Actions]], each [[Character|Character]] has an infinite amount of Incidentals on their turn, and may use Incidentals even when itâ€™s not their Turn.

### Speaking
Speaking, mouthing, sign language (unless your arms are occupied), those sorts of things can all be done as an Incidental, as much as you want.

### Very Simple Interactions
Such as peeking around a corner, grabbing onto an ally, or dropping a currently held [[Items|Item]] onto the ground.

### Sacred Point Usage
[[Sacred Points|Sacred Points]] can be used to activate any [[Weapons|Weapon]] [[Qualities|Quality]] on a successful [[Attack Check|Check]]. Additionally, it can be used to add things to the environment if the GM agrees and it is logical. It can also be used to gain a hint, or to upgrade any check at all, including [[Attack Check|Attacks]].

Additionally, if a Check generates no [[Success|Successes]] but has no secondary symbol, such as [[Threat|Threat]], [[Advantage|Advantage]], [[Triumph|Triumph]], or [[Despair|Despair]], a [[Player|Player]] may spend a Sacred Point to add a Triumph to the roll. The [[The GM|GM]] may also spend a point to add a Despair.
