In [[Encounter|Encounters]], particularly [[Combat|Combat Encounters]], there will often be environmental Hazards or effects that make the situation more difficult to overcome for the [[PC|PCs]]â€“or could be used to their advantage to disorient or damage [[NPCs|NPCs]]. The categories of Hazards are:
- [[Difficult Terrain|Difficult Terrain]]
- [[Ensnaring Terrain|Ensnaring Terrain]]
- [[Fire|Fire]]
- [[Light Haze|Light Haze]]
- [[Thick Haze|Thick Haze]]
- [[Gas|Gas]]
- [[Malice|Malice]]

Keep in mind these are very much just categories, and some Hazards may mix and match, or may introduce new effects.
