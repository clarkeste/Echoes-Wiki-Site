Malice is a cruel, purple-red substance, of which not much is known about. It is often found in areas of great evil, hate, and suffering, or deep underground.

Malice can form into pools and be considered environmental Hazards. There are various different severities of Malice, usually depending on the location and intensity of the hatred and suffering that once lingered here–or still does.

#### Sullied Malice
Water or mud that was tainted by Malice and now assumes a sludge-like state. A purple-red mixed with black, this type of Malice [[Damage|Damages]] anyone who stands in it rapidly. For each [[Actions|Action]] or [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] taken in Sullied Malice, or turn ended while inside Sullied Malice, suffer 2 [[Wounds|Wounds]] that bypass [[Soak|Soak]]. This does not count the first Maneuver to walk into Sullied Malice.

#### Gloom
Gloom is Malice not tainted by another source, but not concentrated enough to reach its full potential. Its effects are much deadlier, but are not as fast-acting as Sullied Malice. For each Turn ended while inside Gloom, decrease [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]] by 1. This does not count the first [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] to walk into Gloom.

#### Pure Malice
Malice born from complete and utter hatred, devoid of anything that would dilute it. For each [[Actions|Action]] or [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] taken in Pure Malice, or turn ended while inside Pure Malice, reduce a [[Character|Character]]’s [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]] by 1. This does not count the first Maneuver to walk into Pure Malice.

While inside any of these [[Hazards|Hazards]], it is possible to make a [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p) [[Athletics|Athletics]] or [[Coordination|Coordination]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] to move anywhere within [[Short Range|Short Range]], without suffering any ill-effects from the Malice.

### Malice Quality
Malice is also the name of a [[Qualities|Quality]]. To read about it, check the [[Malice (Active) (Quality)|Malice (Quality)]] document.
