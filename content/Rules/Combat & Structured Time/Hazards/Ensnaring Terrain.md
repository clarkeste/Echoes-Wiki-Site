Sticky water, an unnatural moss that clings to oneâ€™s feet, or magnetic floors that pull one down by their metal. Regardless of its source, Ensnaring Terrain restrains a [[Character]] in place and makes them unable to move.


**Effect:** When a turn is ended while on Ensnaring Terrain, the Character becomes immediately [[Immobilized]]. This can be escaped by suffering 3 [[Strain|Strain]] or succeeding in the regular [[Actions|Action]] required to become free from the [[Immobilized]] [[Status Effects|Status]]. In some cases, Ensnaring Terrain may also [[Prone|knock a Character down]] at the end of their first turn inside of it.

**Avoidance Check**: May spend an [[Actions|Action]] to attempt an [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p) [[Coordination|Coordination]] or [[Athletics|Athletics]] check to move up to [[Short Range|Short Range]] within Ensnaring Terrain as an Action. When this is done, if the Character ends their Turn in the Ensnaring Terrain, it does not [[Immobilized|Immobilize]] them.
