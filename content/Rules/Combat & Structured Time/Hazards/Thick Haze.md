Intense smog or smoke, whether intentional or the byproduct of large amounts of heat, can obscure vision and cause coughing and irritation, even in the middle of a fight.


**Effect:** The presence of Thick Haze blocks line of sight to everything beyond or inside the cloud. In addition to the same check modifiers as [[Light Haze|Light Haze]], all attacks must use the [[Maneuvers#Called Shot|Called Shot]] [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] to hit targets inside of Thick Haze. 

Additionally, when inside of a cloud of Thick Haze–unless wearing some sort of filtering mask–characters suffer 2 [[Strain|Strain]] for every Maneuver they take inside. The Maneuver to enter does not count. If Thick Haze is close to dissipating, it may turn into Light Haze.

**Avoidance Check:** When inside Thick Haze, may make a [[Difficulty|Daunting]] (4p) [[Cool|Cool]] or [[Discipline|Discipline]] check as an [[Actions|Action]] to avoid incurring any Strain penalties from the smoke for the rest of the [[Encounter|Encounter]].
