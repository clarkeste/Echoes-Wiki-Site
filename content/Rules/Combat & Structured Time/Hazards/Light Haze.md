Fog or a light smoke falls under the Haze category. Largely harmless outside of a fight, buy inside of one it can prove to be a deciding factor as it can obscure the vision of combatants.


**Effect:** When attempting to [[Attack Check|Attack]] an [[Adversary|enemy]] and when your line of sight with that enemy is blocked by Light Haze, suffer two [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] to any attempt to hit them. When a target is inside of the Haze, suffer four [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]].

**Avoidance Check:** None.
