Certain gasses–natural or man-made using elixirs–can be harmful, poisonous, or even deadly to living beings. As is the nature of such things, effects can vary wildly between different types of Gas.

  
**Effect:** The effects of the Gas itself varies between types; some may provide debuffs, while others cause [[Damage|Damage]], [[Strain|Strain]], [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]]; some are transparent, some follow the [[Light Haze|Haze]] rules. Just like [[Light Haze|Light Haze]] and [[Thick Haze|Thick Haze]], Gas may naturally dissipate over time.

**Avoidance Check:** Most Gasses must be inhaled to work. As an [[Incidentals|Incidental]], make a [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p) [[Cool|Cool]] or [[Discipline|Discipline]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] will stall the effects of the Gas until the end of the [[Character|Character]]’s next turn, where it will be rolled again until the Check fails. Once the Check fails, it may not be rolled again for that [[Encounter|Encounter]].
