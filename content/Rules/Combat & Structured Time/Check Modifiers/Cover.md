Cover in [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]] is protection offered by the environment or location, that when hidden behind, makes it harder for [[Attack Check|Attacks]] to hit their target. This is relevant in [[Combat|Combat]], where it adds [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] to [[Attack Check|Attack Checks]] targeting an enemy who is behind Cover. From which direction(s) Cover protects a player is dependent on the cover, as is the amount of Setbacks on the check.

There are four levels of Cover: Minor, which grants one Setback; Medium, which grants two Setbacks; Large, which grants three Setbacks; and Complete, which means you cannot be targeted if the cover appliesâ€“essentially, blocking line of sight.
