Critical Injuries are serious, lasting pains that your [[Character|Character]] suffers, often from [[Critical Hit|Critical Hits]]. They rarely [[Natural Recovery|heal naturally]], and can lead to persistent disabilities if not remedied.

When a Critical Injury is inflicted, the character affected rolls a d100–a one-hundred sided die. The results are then modified by multitudes of +10 or -10 depending on various criteria. These include [[Talents|Talents]] like [[Lethal Blows|Lethal Blows]], [[Qualities|Qualities]] like [[Vicious (Passive) (Quality)|Vicious]], or previous Critical Injuries, each previous Injury adding +10.

The final number determines what Critical Injury you received, according to the table of results. This can vary from a mild jolt, to a major injury, to death in extreme cases.

In [[RPGSessions|RPGSessions]], to make a Critical Injury roll, navigate to the [[Game Table|Game Table]]. Then, select your [[Character|Character]] towards the top-left of the screen.
