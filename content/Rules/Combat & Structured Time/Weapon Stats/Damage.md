Damage is dealt to a target during a successful [[Attack Check]]. Each [[Weapons|Weapon]] has an amount of Damage it does; melee Weapons almost always have a “+” next to the number, which means the Damage is increased by [[Brawn]].

Incoming Damage is reduced by the [[Soak]] of a [[Character|Character]]. Any Damage that is not reduced by Soak is added as [[Wounds]].

During an Attack Check, each uncanceled [[Success]] on the Check adds one more Damage.

#### Base Damage
‘Base Damage’ refers to the Damage of a Weapon or Attack without taking into account any Successes gained on the check.
