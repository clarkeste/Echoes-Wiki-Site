Any Monster can be wreathed in Maliceâ€“often if they are deep underground or near large sources of [[Malice|Malice]]. When this happens, the [[Adversary|enemy]] gains +4 [[Soak|Soak]], +2 [[Damage|Damage]] to all Attacks, and the [[Malice (Active) (Quality)|Malice Quality]] is added to all [[Attack Check|Attacks]].

[[Sacred Luster (Passive) (Quality)|Sacred Luster]] will now activate near these enemies, as well.
