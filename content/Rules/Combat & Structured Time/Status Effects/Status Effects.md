Status Effects include [[Disoriented|Disoriented]], [[Prone|Prone]], [[Staggered|Staggered]], [[Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Debilitated|Debilitated]], and [[Oppressed|Oppressed]]. While not true for every Status Effect, most of them can be added on [[RPGSessions|RPGSessions]] for easy tracking.

#### Adding Status Effects to RPGSessions
First, navigate to your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]]. Editing Status Effects is mot useful on the [[Game Table|Game Table]], so it is suggested you navigate there first.

This will open your Character Sheet on the Game Table below your characterâ€™s icon. 

To edit Status Effects, look directly right to where the name of your [[Character|Character]] on the Character Sheet is listed. There, there are four icons. When hovering over them, you will see their names, in order, are: Disoriented, Prone, Staggered, and Immobilized.

By clicking on one of them, you activate the Status Effect. This has no automating effect, and is primarily just to easily keep track of these Status Effects.
