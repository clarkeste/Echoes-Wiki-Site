At the beginning of [[Combat|Combat]], each [[PC|PC]] and [[NPCs|NPC]] must make an Initiative Check, with no [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]] unless under special circumstances. This Check uses [[Vigilance|Vigilance]] if the [[Character|Character]] is caught by surprise, or [[Cool|Cool]] if the Character was expecting this encounter. The amount of [[Success|Successes]] you roll determines your spot in the Initiative order, with [[Advantage|Advantages]] acting as tiebreakers. Triumphs will allow an out-of-turn Maneuver when rolling Initiative, before the Combat begins.

To do this with [[RPGSessions|RPGSessions]], navigate to the [[Game Table|Game Table]]. There, select the polyhedral button and open the dice rolling panel.

This will open the Dice rolling panel. There, hit the ‘Add Initiative’ button. This means that your roll results will add an Initiative slot.

Then, add [[Narrative Dice|Dice]]. You can do this either by adding it manually using the symbols on the Dice Panel, or by doing it using your character sheet directly. To do this, first open your [[Character Sheet|Character Sheet]] on the Game Table.

Then, click on the applicable Initiative [[Skills|Skill]]–usually [[Cool|Cool]] or [[Vigilance|Vigilance]].

This should result in your dice pool automatically appearing in the dice panel. Just add any additional [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]] or [[Boost Dice|Boosts]], and hit roll!

Alternatively, on Discord using the [[RPGSessions Bot]], use the “.i r pc (skill)” command to roll initiative, replacing (skill) with the name of the applicable Skill. It will automatically role as your currently active character.
