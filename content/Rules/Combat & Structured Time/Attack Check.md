The Attack Check is a type of [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]] done during [[Combat|Combat]] with the intent to deal [[Damage|Damage]] to another [[Character|Character]]. It is usually done with a [[Weapons|Weapon]] like a Sword or Bow, but can be done unarmed with just fists as well.

Unlike most other checks, the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of Attack checks is determined by the distance of the active character to the [[Adversary|target]] they are Attacking, determined by [[Range Bands|Range Bands]]. 

### Determine Weapon and Skill
Every weapon will have a [[Skills|Skill]] associated with it that determines what Skill must be rolled when the Weapon is used.

First, navigate to the [[Game Table|Game Table]] and select your Character from the top-left.

Once it opens the character sheet, scroll down past the Skill section until you reach a part that says “WEAPONS”. This section lists any and all weapons you have previously assigned to your character. It lists things such as the Damage, the [[Critical Rating|Critical Rating]], the Range of the Weapon, and the [[Qualities|Qualities]] it has.

Damage, as one might imagine, indicates how much Damage a Weapon does. Higher is often better. 

‘Crit’ refers to the Critical Rating of a weapon. A number of [[Advantage|Advantage]] equal to the Critical Rating must be spent to activate it, thereby dealing a[[Critical Injury| Critical Injury]]. A [[Triumph|Triumph]] can activate a Critical Injury no matter what. When it comes to Critical Ratings, lower is better.

The Range column shows the maximum Range Band a Weapon can be used in. In the case of the Soldier’s Broadsword, this range is [[Engaged Range|Engaged]]. It cannot go further than this range.

The Qualities section lists any special modifiers the weapon may have. In the case of the Soldier’s Broadsword, this is Accurate 1 and Quick Strike. To add these, check the [[Modifiers (RPGSessions)]] document.

To roll, click on the Dice icons in the “Skill” column, right underneath where it says the Skill required. This automatically opens and adds the correct positive dice to the Dice Panel. To continue, we must then determine the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of the check.

### Range Bands and Determining Difficulty
In Attack Checks, the Difficulty is determined by Range. While the GM may still add [[Setback Dice|Setbacks]], [[Boost Dice|Boosts]], upgrade some [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]] to [[Challenge Dice|Challenge Dice]], or various other modifiers could impact it such as [[Moving Target|Moving Target]], the base Difficulty itself tends to be a little more objectively determined.

There are six Range Bands in [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]], each conferring a different Difficulty. To read about Range Bands in depth, including what each one means, click on Range Bands. This section will only go over how they impact difficulty.

#### Engaged
Attacking a [[Character|Character]] within [[Engaged Range|Engaged Range]] is 2 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Average]]” [[Difficulty|Difficulty]]. Weapons using the [[Gunnery|Gunnery]] Skill cannot attack a target within Engaged Range.

#### Short
Attacking a [[Character|Character]] within [[Short Range|Short Range]] is 1 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Die]], or “[[Difficulty|Easy]]" [[Difficulty|Difficulty]].

![](https://i.imgur.com/czQ7j3h.png)

#### Medium
Attacking a [[Character|Characte]]r within [[Medium Range|Medium Range]] is 2 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Average]]” [[Difficulty|Difficulty]].

![](https://i.imgur.com/SKderG4.png)

#### Long
Attacking a [[Character|Character]] within [[Long Range|Long Range]] is 3 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Hard]]” [[Difficulty|Difficulty]].

![](https://i.imgur.com/zC2vSyb.png)

#### Extreme
Attacking a [[Character|Character]] within [[Extreme Range|Extreme Range]] is 4 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Daunting]]" [[Difficulty|Difficulty]].

![](https://i.imgur.com/a839KN4.png)

#### Strategic
Attacking a target within [[Strategic Range|Strategic Range]] is often impossible, as very few [[Weapons|Weapons]] reach this distance. When it is possible, it is–by default–5 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Formidable]]” [[Difficulty|Difficulty]].

### Rolling on Discord Directly
This guide is the [[RPGSessions Bot]], for Discord. Use the “.r (weapon){dice} {description}” command to roll using a Weapon. In the (weapon) value, add the name of your weapon, such as (Soldier’s Broadsword). Do not remove the (parentheses). Specifying which Weapon you use will automate the Skill, and any Qualities that effect the roll, such as [[Accurate (Passive) (Quality)|Accurate]] or [[Superior (Passive) (Quality)|Superior]].

The Dice field is for the Difficulty of the roll, or any additional Setbacks, Boosts, or other modifiers. The Description field is optional but it adds an explanation to the Game Table for the roll. Make sure to remove the {brackets} when filling these fields.

If you wish to change the naming scheme of the Dice–whether you use the color or name to roll the dice–navigate to your profile settings.

### Rolling and Results
Once you’ve assembled the Dice Pool, it’s time to roll. Hit the “Roll as” button to roll the dice, and let fate decide what happens next.

Once a dice pool is rolled, its results are displayed both on the right side of the screen in “History & Messages”, and the Dice channel on the Discord server. This is where the core of the [[Narrative Dice|Narrative Dice]] system comes into play–determining what the results of a roll mean.

While [[Success|Success]] and [[Failure|Failure]] are simple to understand, other symbols–[[Advantage|Advantage]] and [[Threat|Threat]], [[Triumph|Triumph]] and [[Despair|Despair]]–represents additional side-benefits or complications in what is already a Success or Failure.

By default, the [[The GM|GM]] determines how Threat and Despair are spent, although in some cases (such as checks made by [[NPCs|NPCs]] where the GM wishes to give [[Player|Players]] an option) he may give the players the option to spend these instead.

Remember that the following table is only a set of ideas and examples. It exists solely to give individuals an idea of what effect each amount of Advantage could have, or be picked from if it’s the most logical, beneficial or the Players have no other ideas.

In some cases, effects listed may cost less due to the particulars of the battlefield.
