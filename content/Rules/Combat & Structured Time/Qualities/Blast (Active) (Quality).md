Not to be confused with [[Blast (Modifier)|Blast (Modifier)]].

If an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]] with Blast is successful and Blast is activated with 2 [[Advantage|Advantage]], each [[Character|Character]] [[Engaged Range|Engaged]] with the original target–even if they are an ally–suffers [[Damage|Damage]] equal to the [[Weapons|Weapon]]'s Blast rating.

May also trigger Blast if the Attack misses by spending 3 aAdvantages. If this happens, the initial target suffers Blast Damage as well.
