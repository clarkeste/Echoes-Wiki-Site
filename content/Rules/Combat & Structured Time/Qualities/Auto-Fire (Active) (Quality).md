Not to be confused with [[Auto-Fire (Modifier)|Auto-Fire (Modifier)]].

Auto-Fire typically allows a [[Weapons|Weapon]] to attack multiple times in the same same [[Attack Check|Check]] if enough [[Advantage|Advantage]] is gained, either on the same target or different targets.

On a successful Check, may trigger Auto-Fire by spending 2 Advantages an unlimited number of times; each time Auto-Fire is triggered, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional attack from that Weapon, and each hit deals [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] plus the number of uncanceled Successes on the Check.

Additional hits can be allocated to the original target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. Only targets that wouldâ€™ve had an easier or identical Check [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] if directly targeted can be hit this way.
