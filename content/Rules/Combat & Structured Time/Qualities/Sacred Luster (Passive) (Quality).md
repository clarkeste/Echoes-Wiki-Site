Some [[Weapons|Weapons]], crafted in ancient times to repel evil, contain a sacred power that can not be easily replicated. Legends speak of the Sword that Seals the Darkness, or the Four Sword. Such weapons, designed to fight evil, excel against enemies that use or are cloaked in the dark embrace of [[Malice-Wreathed Monsters|Malice]] and hatred.

When attacking an [[Adversary|enemy]] that uses Malice or is wreathed in it, Weapons with Sacred Luster bypass 10 points of [[Soak|Soak]] for every Sacred Luster rating. A sword with Sacred Luster 1, for instance, would bypass 10 Soak against an enemy cloaked in Malice.
