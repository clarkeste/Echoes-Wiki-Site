Not to be confused with [[Stun Damage (Modifier)|Stun Damage (Modifier)]].

As opposed to the regular [[Stun (Active) (Quality)|Stun]] [[Qualities|Quality]] which interacts with [[Strain|Strain]] secondarily in addition to an [[Attack Check|Attack]] interacting with [[Wounds|Wounds]], Stun Damage instead makes the effects of the Attack interact primarily with Strain, replacing Wounds.

Attacks will no longer deal regular [[Damage|Damage]]; instead, they deal Stun Damage that will lower Strain. Stun Damage, however, is still reduced by [[Soak|Soak]]. Stun Damage cannot deal [[Critical Injury|Critical Injuries]].
