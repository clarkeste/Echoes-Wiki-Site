Not to be confused with [[Cumbersome (Modifier)|Cumbersome (Modifier)]].

To wield a [[Weapons|Weapon]] with Cumbersome properly, the [[Character|Character]] must have a [[Brawn|Brawn]] [[Characteristics|Characteristic]] equal to or greater than the Weapon's Cumbersome rating. For each point deficient, increase the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of all [[Attack Check|Checks]] made while using the Weapon by one.

When dual-wielding a Weapon, even if the secondary Weapon is not being used, the Cumbersome [[Qualities|Quality]] will still apply to the Check so long as the secondary weapon is in one of the Characterâ€™s hands. For example, if a Character with Brawn 2 is holding a Sword in one hand and a [[Shields|Shield]] with Cumbersome 3 in the other, they will increase the Difficulty of the Check by one for any attack they make while holding the Shield, even if the attack is made exclusively with the Sword.
