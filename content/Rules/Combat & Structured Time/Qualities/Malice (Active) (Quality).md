Not to be confused with [[Malice (Modifier)|Malice (Modifier)]].

Malice is a red and black substance generated by the overwhelming hatred of both the downtrodden and the despicable. In ancient lore, it is said to be connected to the Demon Tribe. While it is primarily present in [[Spell Creation|Spells]], some [[Weapons|Weapons]] that have been corrupted or constructed with Malice may feature this [[Qualities|Quality]] as well.

Malice is not ranked. If it is activated with two [[Advantage|Advantage]], then the target must roll a [[Resilience]] [[Skill Checks|Check]]. If the Check fails, [[Damage|Damage]] dealt is reduced to 25% and instead reduces the victimâ€™s maximum [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]]. Very few things can heal this ailment. 

Unless the [[Character|Character]] using Malice has already been subsumed by it, roll a D20 whenever attacking. If a 1 is rolled, reduce the Wound Threshold of the user by 1.

Additionally, whenever an Enemy is defeated with a Weapon that has the Malice Quality, a pool of Malice forms around the corpse. This effect can also be triggered with a [[Triumph]] on any roll.
