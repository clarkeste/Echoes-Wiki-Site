Not to be confused with Desperate Strength (Modifier).

When the user of a [[Weapons|Weapon]] is at above half their maximum [[Wound Threshold|Wound Threshold]], the Weaponâ€™s [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] is doubled until the [[Character|Character]] is healed. This does not stack with [[Water Warrior (Passive) (Quality)|Water Warrior]]. [[Ranged|Ranged]] Weapons only increase their [[Damage|Damage]] by 50%, rounding up.
