Not to be confused with [[Unwieldy (Modifier)|Unwieldy (Modifier)]],

To wield a [[Weapons|Weapon]] with Unwieldy properly, the [[Character|Character]] must have an [[Agility]] [[Characteristics|Characteristic]] equal to or greater than the Weapon's Unwieldy rating. For each point deficient, increase the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of all [[Attack Check|Checks]] made while using the Weapon by one.

When dual-wielding a Weapon, even if the secondary Weapon is not being used, the Unwieldy [[Qualities|Quality]] will still apply to the Check so long as the secondary weapon is in one of the Characterâ€™s hands. For example, if a Character with Unwieldy 2 is holding a Sword in one hand and a [[Shields|Shield]] with Unwieldy 3 in the other, they will increase the Difficulty of the Check by one for any attack they make while holding the Shield, even if the attack is made exclusively with the Sword.
