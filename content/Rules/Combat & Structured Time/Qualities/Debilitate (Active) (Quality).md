Debilitate has the power to disable its targets, particularly affecting their capacity to use [[Spell Creation|Magic]], for a short period of time.

In an [[Attack Check]], disables the ability for the opponent to cast magic for Rounds equal to the attackâ€™s Debilitate rating. A Character suffering from this has the [[Debilitated]] [[Status Effects|Status Effect.]] To apply, must spend 4 [[Advantage|Advantages]] or a [[Triumph]] on a successful check that would deal [[Wounds]] or [[Strain]]. If Debilitate is used, then the attack deals no [[Damage]].
