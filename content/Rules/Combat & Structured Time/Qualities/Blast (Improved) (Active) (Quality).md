Not to be confused with [[Blast (Improved) (Modifier)|Blast (Improved) (Modifier)]].

Blast (Improved) depicts a large explosion that catches everyone within about ten meters of its explosive fury. It is often used on cannons or other artillery pieces, or barrels containing large amounts of gunpowder.

Unlike regular [[Blast (Active) (Quality)|Blast]], this version of the [[Qualities|Quality]] reaches into [[Short Range|Short Range]] instead of [[Engaged Range|Engaged]]. Itâ€™s also not entirely uncommon, making grouping up dangerous if a [[Weapons|Weapon]] with this [[Qualities|Quality]] is present.
