Not to be confused with [[Shock (Modifier)|Shock (Modifier)]].

[[Attack Check|Attacks]] that use electricity can cause a shock to its target, forcing them to drop their [[Weapons|Weapons]]. Additionally, electricityâ€™s conductivity can allow a Weapon that uses it to reach much further than it otherwise would.
  
When making an Attack using a Weapon that has the Shock Quality, the user can spend three [[Advantage|Advantage]] to disarm an enemy without losing the [[Damage|Damage]] of the attack. While disarmament is an option for the same cost with a weapon that has no Shock, it requires a Successful Attack and giving up any Damage dealt.

In addition, Shock will deal [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] to any other creature connected to the original target via anything made of metal, such as a floor, wall, chain, or any other object. Water will conduct Shock up to [[Short Range|Short Range]].
