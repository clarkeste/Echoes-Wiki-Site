Not to be confused with [[Burn (Modifier)|Burn (Modifier)]].

On a successful [[Attack Check|Attack Check]], may spend 2 [[Advantage|Advantage]] to use Burn on a target. A target afflicted with Burn continues to suffer the [[Weapons|Weapon]]'s [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] each Round for a number of Rounds equal to the Weapon's Burn rating. [[Damage|Damage]] is applied at the start of each of the target's turns.
  
As an [[Actions|Action]], a character suffering from Burn may make an [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p) [[Coordination|Coordination]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] to put out the flames. Water, too, will put out fire.
