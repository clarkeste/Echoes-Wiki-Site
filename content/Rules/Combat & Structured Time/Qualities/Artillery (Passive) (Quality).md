The Artillery [[Qualities|Quality]] denotes that this weapon cannot directly attack a target that is [[Silhouette|Silhouette]] 2 or smaller; instead, it is primarily designed to eliminate large targets with explosives. As such, [[Weapons|Weapons]] with this quality often have large [[Damage|Damage]] outputs, and a large amount of [[Blast (Active) (Quality)|Blast]]. [[Adversary|Enemies]] that are Silhouette 2 or smaller may still be damaged through Blast, with the target being the general area in which they stand.
