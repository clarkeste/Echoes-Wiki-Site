Not to be confused with [[Flammable (Modifier)|Flammable (Modifier)]].

Almost always due to being made of wood, this item is easily flammable; fire spreads across it easily, setting it alight.

If a [[Weapons|Weapon]] with the Flammable quality is exposed to flame, it will last only one more Round before it is destroyed by the flame unless it is put out. However, for that Round, the Weapon gains [[Burn (Active) (Quality)|Burn]] 2.
