Not to be confused with [[Blast (Supreme) (Modifier)|Blast (Supreme) (Modifier)]].

Blast (Supreme) depicts an immense explosion that catches everyone within a few dozen meters of its fireball. It is often used on some very destructive weaponry such as the cannons on the largest Dreadnaughts, or for large explosions like a dozen barrels chained together.

Unlike regular [[Blast (Modifier)|Blast]], this version of the [[Qualities|Quality]] reaches into [[Medium Range|Medium Range]] instead of [[Engaged Range|Engaged]]. While Blast (Supreme) is rare, its presence can drastically change a fightâ€™s trajectory.
