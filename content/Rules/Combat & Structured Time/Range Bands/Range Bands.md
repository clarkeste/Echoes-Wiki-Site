Range Bands are how distance and range are represented in [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]], using a more narrative and loose system than some other other [[TTRPGs|TTRPGs]].

Rather than have a [[Player|Player]]â€™s attention focused on a square grid, Echoes of the Departed uses more abstract means to represent position, distance, and range, thus allowing the Players to focus on the action and adventure.

Range Bands usually determine the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]]. Specifically, it is determined by the distance between the target and the attacker.

- [[Short Range|Short Range]]
- [[Medium Range|Medium Range]]
- [[Long Range|Long Range]]
- [[Extreme Range|Extreme Range]]
