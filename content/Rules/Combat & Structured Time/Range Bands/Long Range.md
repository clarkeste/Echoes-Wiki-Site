Long range is further than a few dozen meters. Quality bows, mounted [[Weapons|Weapons]], and Weapons that use the [[Gunnery|Gunnery]] [[Skills|Skill]] can reliably reach this far without too much trouble. Two people in Long Range of each other need to yell loudly to hear each other.

**40-70 Meters of distance** is the distance approximately represented by Long.

### Movement
Moving from [[Medium Range|Medium Range]] to Long Range requires two [[Maneuvers|Maneuvers]], as the distance between them is longer than between [[Medium Range|Medium Range]] and [[Short Range|Short Range]]. This means that in most cases, a character cannot close the distance between [[Short Range|Short]] and [[Long Range]] in a single Round, as it would take three Maneuvers (one for [[Short Range|Short]] to [[Medium Range|Medium]], two for [[Medium Range|Medium]] to Long). The reverse is also true.

Moving between Long Range and [[Extreme Range|Extreme Range]] requires two [[Maneuvers|Maneuvers]], and vice versa.

### Attack Difficulty
In [[Combat|Combat]], the distance between a [[Character|Character]] and their target determines the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]].

Attacking a Character within Long Range is 3 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Hard]]” Difficulty.
