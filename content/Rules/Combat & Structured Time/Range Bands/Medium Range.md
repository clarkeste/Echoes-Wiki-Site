Medium Range can be up to several dozen meters away. Most reliable bows can reach up to Medium Range. Most thrown [[Weapons|Weapons]] can reach this far. Two people in Medium Range of each other need to talk loudly to hear each other.

**10-40 Meters of distance** is the distance approximately represented by Medium.

### Movement
Moving from [[Short Range|Short Range]] to Medium Range requires only one [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]], and vice versa.

Moving from Medium Range to [[Long Range|Long Range]] requires two [[Maneuvers|Maneuvers]], as the distance between them is longer than between Medium Range and [[Short Range|Short Range]]. This means that in most cases, a [[Character|Character]] cannot close the distance between [[Short Range|Short]] and [[Long Range|Long Range]] in a single Round, as it would take three Maneuvers (one for Short to Medium, two for Medium to Long). The reverse is also true.

### Attack Difficulty
In [[Combat|Combat]], the distance between a Character and their target determines the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]].

Attacking a character within Medium Range is 2 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Average]]” Difficulty.
