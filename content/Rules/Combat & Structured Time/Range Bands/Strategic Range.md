Strategic Range represents distances beyond[[Extreme Range| Extreme Range]]. At this range, people cannot see one another with the naked eye, or hear each other shout. Thus, it is rarely used. However, Strategic Range is still useful for certain [[Gunnery|Gunnery]] [[Weapons|Weapons]] with a long range, such as the [[Cannons|Cannons]] found on a ship. Often, Strategic Range Weapons do not have a direct line of sight.

Indirect-fire weapons such as artillery often function at Strategic Range, as do self-guided weapons.

**400-2000 meters of distance** is the distance approximately represented by Strategic.

### Movement
It is usually not possible to move between [[Extreme Range|Extreme]] and Strategic range in an [[Encounter|Encounter]].

### Attack Difficulty
In [[Combat|Combat]], the distance between a [[Character|Character]] and their target determines the [[Difficulty|Difficulty]] of an [[Attack Check|Attack Check]].

Attacking a target within [[Strategic Range|Strategic Range]] is often impossible, as very few Weapons reach this distance. When it is possible, it is–by default–5 [[Difficulty Dice|Difficulty Dice]], or “[[Difficulty|Formidable]]” Difficulty.
