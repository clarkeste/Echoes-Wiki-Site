Combat occurs when a tense situation can no longer be resolved through words or negotiation, and the blades of war are unsheathed as a result.

In [[Echoes of the Departed|Echoes of the Departed]], when combat begins, the game enters structured time. This means that actions are now done during a turn order. To begin Combat, [[Initiative|Initiative]] must be determined.

After Initiative is determined, the Round begins. All [[Character|Characters]] who rolled Initiative go in a Round, until–after the turn of the last character–the next Round begins, allowing Characters who previously acted to go again. Unlike in many other games, any [[PC|PC]] that has not yet done so that Round can take a turn in a ‘PC Slot’ and any [[NPCs|NPC]] can go in an ‘NPC Slot’ if the same conditions are met.

On each individual turn, a character is given an [[Actions|Action]], a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]], and an infinite amount of [[Incidentals|Incidentals]]. They have the possibility to gain another Maneuver by exchanging their Action for one, suffering 2 [[Strain|Strain]], or spending 2 [[Advantage|Advantage]]. A PC cannot have more than 2 Maneuvers in a turn. To see what is possible to do with [[Actions|Actions]], [[Maneuvers|Maneuvers]], and [[Incidentals|Incidentals]], please click on their names and read the corresponding article. The [[Attack Check|Attack Check]], however, is likely the most important Action.

A Combat ends when one side surrenders, dies, falls [[Incapacitated|unconscious]], flees, or is otherwise incapacitated. Each Player Character has a chance to catch their breath and recover Strain by rolling a [[Cool|Cool]] or [[Discipline|Discipline]] check with no [[Difficulty|Difficulty]], healing Strain equal to [[Success|Successes]] and Advantages rolled. They may also take steps to help [[Medicine|heal]] any wounded Player Characters.
