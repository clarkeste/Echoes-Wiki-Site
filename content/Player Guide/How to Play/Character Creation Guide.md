Welcome to the Character Creation Guide. This will guide you through the process of making a new [[Characteristics|Characteristic]] in the [[Echoes of the Departed|Legend of Zelda: Echoes of the Departed]].
## Where do I make my Character?
[On this website!](https://www.rpgsessions.com/) It is convenient, pleasing to look at, and it automates a lot of the finer details. It’s called [[RPGSessions]]. To get started, pick a [[Peoples|People]] and go its template sheet and copy it. That’ll be your starting template.

If you mean where to get a character image or appearance, essentially any source is fine, including simply googling images until you find one you like. However, it’s usually recommended to use an image that’s actually a piece of artwork as opposed to something like a game screenshot. You’re going to see your character icon a lot–it might as well look good.
# Steps

## Step 1 - Select a People
The [[Peoples]] are species, ethnicities, or cultural backgrounds. These determine your starting characteristics, and often how your [[Character|Character]] is initially viewed in society.

## Step 2 - Determine Story and Burden
[[Burdens and Backstory|Burdens]] are secondary obligations to your character; a dark secret they would rather not be revealed, a ghastly pursuer, or a debt which is rapidly coming due and which the creditors are more than willing to use violence to enforce.

But they are just one part of your character’s [[Burdens and Backstory|Story]]–their backstory, essentially. What happened to them before the game? What makes them unique? What in life did they go through before arriving where they are now? And how does all this impact their story taking place now? What ghosts of the past, of the departed, haunt them even now?

## Step 3 - Select or Create a Career
[[Careers]] are like your character’s ‘Class’. They determine what your character is initially good at, or specialized to do–in particular, they make it easier for you to grow in Skills which are considered [[Career Skills]]. Every Career has 8 Career Skills. You may tailor your own Careers, following a few guidelines, to fit your characters like a glove.

## Step 4 - Spend Experience Points
All the Peoples you can play as start with a different amount of [[Experience Points]], listed on their sheets. These Experience Points, or XP, can be spent on various things. These include [[Characteristics]], [[Skills]], and [[Talents]]. You also gain Experience Points while playing the game.

It should be noted that it is generally suggested to spend as much of your starting XP as possible on Characteristics, as they become much harder to upgrade later on.

## Step 5 - Determine Derived Attributes
[[Derived Attributes]] refer to things such as [[Wound Threshold]], [[Strain Threshold]], or [[Soak]]. These are based on the Characteristics and Talents you have, and it is important to determine them.

## Step 6 - Purchase with Rupees
[[Rupees|Rupee]] are the primary currency, not just in Hyrule, but much of the world. While that may change soon seeing as the Civil War has destabilized Hyrule’s currency, it is still the money with which almost everything is bought; if it be [[Armor]], [[Weapons]], tools, or [[Shields]]. Every character starts with 1000 Rupees. This can be spent in the stores. [Anything in this document is purchasable](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1hvwJL_XvC9PeIaPHGaZWiC3Cd1IoqKs_B8Qg98Lk4s0/edit), so long as your character is not incompatible with a weapon’s [[Affiliations]] (determined by the [[The GM|GM]] and [[Player]] based on the backstory). What would your character use, or own? If they have a weapon, this is the time to buy one.

## Step 7 - Use Additional Experience
If you are reading this after the game has already been running for some time, it is possible that some XP has already been awarded to Players for their Adventures. So that new characters are not left behind, there is a baseline of additional Experience that is updated as the game progresses. This XP counts as if your character gained it after Character Creation, meaning it cannot be spent on Characteristics.

Current Highest XP Awarded: 0

Current +XP for New Characters: 0

## Step 8 - Send Character to the GM!
Once your Character Sheet is complete and done–on [[RPGSessions]], preferably–then send it over to me! I’ll take a look at it, maybe ask a few questions about the story or where XP was spent, and then I’ll approve it! Then, you’re ready to play.
