[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/pbp/comments/1az482w/weaponizing_the_medium_keeping_the_game_alive_as/) is an excellent post on the matter, as it pertains to PbPs. It’s been pasted below for your convenience.

*Hi all!*

*Recently, I’ve been noticing an uptick in popular [doomer-style posts.](https://old.reddit.com/r/pbp/comments/17vhuo5/i_think_im_over_pbp/) This, in combination with the fact that since my last posts in this “series” (although I would personally hesitate to call the posts little more than an unhinged collection of micro-rants), I’ve taken something of a sabbatical from running games is what has prompted me to write this post on **how to keep games alive as a player.** Keep in mind that this is the brain-abomination of a single person, borne from the things*

*Now, I’m by no means saying that these tips are bulletproof, and that you can carry the game alone - at the end of the day, if the GM decides to up and leave, or people find themselves disinterested, or things just blow up, there’s not really much you can do about it. Still, I believe these tips can both greatly increase the longevity of your game, and also the enjoyment both you - and perhaps more importantly, your table - derive from the game.*

***1 - Yes, and // No, but***

*‘Yes, and’ is a rule in improvisation that suggests that when an improviser takes their ‘turn’, they should not only react to what the previous person has said or done (Yes,) but rather also expand on that line of thinking. When translated to roleplay, the rule becomes even simpler: **don’t just react to what other people are doing, but also give them something to react to.***

*While this is a tip that is just as applicable to GM’s as it is to players, I’ve put it up front because it’s just that important. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING can kill the momentum of a scene like a player only reacting to what is happening to them without offering anything for other people to bounce off of. It’s akin to messaging someone and only receiving single-word responses - it’s a horrible experience, and leaves you with no idea of what to say or do next.*

*Now, while it’s inevitable that your character will sometimes simply not have anything useful to contribute to a scene, that doesn’t mean that they have nothing to give other players to work with. While the cleric may not be able to do anything useful as the rogue is disarming traps in the dungeon, they can always offer other people the chance to ‘Yes, and’ them by doing the following:*

*-Flesh out your character. Perhaps talk about how the current situation makes them feel, invent an anecdote that is relevant to the scenario (or one that’s hilariously irrelevant, if that’s the type of person your character is!), or react in a novel way to the scenario.*

*-Show some curiosity. Ask questions of both players and the GM, prompt them to reveal something of interest, or simply give them the platform and timing to talk about something that interests them or their character.*

*-Start planning for the next step. Prompt your character and the rest of the party on what they’d like to do next. This doesn’t need to be limited to the short term, either - ‘What do you want to do when the war is over?’ is often just as interesting a question as ‘What do you think is on the other side of that door?’*

***2- Make friends!***

*Whether or not you like it, the reality is that how much you enjoy the company of the other people around the table is often more important to the longevity of a game than the actual quality of the game itself. I’ve seen otherwise dead games be resurrected after months simply due to the fact that everyone in the game was friends with each other, and I've seen games that would’ve stalled out successfully pivot because people were still talking even when the game wasn’t running.*

*Now, it’s no secret that tabletop gaming is a magnet for introverts, and play-by-post only exacerbates the issue - but trust me, the people that you’re in games with often share your hobbies, your interests, and tastes. Go out there! Make some friends!*

*And to the GM’s reading this post: try asking your players what interests them in your application form! It’ll help you find common ground both between yourself and them, and between each other to help facilitate friendships!*

***3- Think ahead and have a motivation for your character in the scene***

*The very best games are the games that have the players and the GM thinking about it all the time. When they’re at work, when they’re in the car, when they’re showering - constantly. Now while this normally works inversely ( a good game causes people to be thinking about it constantly), remember that as a player **you** contribute directly to the quality of the game.*

*Forcing yourself to think ahead and ruminate on the things that motivate your character is a great way to get yourself into the habit of thinking about the game constantly - and believe me when I say that it’s obvious when someone is invested or not, and that investment can rub off on people.*

***4- DON’T CLICK THE NOTIFICATION***

*Now, the number one cause for me to not respond to a post in time is always that **I forget.** And why do I forget? Because the discord notification is not there reminding me that there’s something I need to do. It’s for this reason that I **never click the discord notification or into the channel until I’m ready to respond.** If you’re one of those people that finds that they can’t write good posts unless they’re at their desk, or they have a coffee on hand, or they’re in the right emotional headspace, then make sure that you have those things you need before you click away that notification.*

***5- Don’t apply for every game***

*Lastly, and most importantly, is to ensure that **you’re playing a game that you want to play**. None of the above tips matter if you yourself do not want to keep a game going - and the most important part of ensuring that you’re in a game you want to play is to be as scrutinizing with the posts you apply to as GMs are with the applicants they receive. Remember - application forms and advertisements are **not** just for GM’s to sort players - they’re also to let players know what kind of game they’re applying to.*

*And remember: No D&D is better than bad D&D.*

Hey, it’s Clark again. Here are some other videos have good tips. Keep in mind, though, that they’re assuming an in-person game, so not all tips are applicable. I do not expect you to mail me a pencil.
