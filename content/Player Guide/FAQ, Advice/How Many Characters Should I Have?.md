You are allowed to have anywhere between 1 and 5 [[Character Sheet|Characters]]. It is encouraged to have at least two. This is so that whenever you are playing one of them, the other can be using [[Downtime]] to do actions off-screen. 

This way, you can have your characters be progressing in multiple ways at the same time. Having multiple characters also allows you to experience more of the narrative, and alleviate issues of being forced to wait on other players. If Character #1 is involved in a multi-player adventure that is taking some time, then Character #2 can be on a separate quest by themselves at the same time. With just you and the [[The GM|GM]], the story that Character is on will likely proceed at a more enjoyable pace.
