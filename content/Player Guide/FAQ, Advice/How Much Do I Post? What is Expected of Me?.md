It is expected that you will post at least 3-5 times each day, depending on who is waiting on you. If other [[Player|Players]] are waiting on you, you may be expected to post more so that the game can continue. If it just you and the [[The GM|GM]], a slower rate of posting is entirely fine.

Try to keep the GM informed about how much you can post, or how active you believe you will be, so that the GM can make sure to not put you into any situations where youâ€™re expected to go particularly fast.

If other Players are waiting on one of your [[Character Sheet|Characters]] to make an action and you are unavailable for a significant stretch of time, the GM may decide to take an action for your character to advance the story. The GM will always try to make sure this is in-character, and will balance that will having it be a simple action so that no major choices are made for your character without your consent.
