Even most neutral characters will have a preference between the Royalists and the Followers However, the two seem so fundamentally opposed, and the facts so muddled; how do I decide which side my character would lean towards?

Your character may lean more towards the Royalists if they:

- Believe that generally things are better when time-tested rules are properly observed, and that the people in charge of enforcing them are generally competent.
- Believe that success in most facets of life in areas such as wealth is objective and entirely skill-based, outside of situations where malicious actors conspire to make others have less of a chance.
- Believe strongly in tradition, religion, and honor, particularly all of those things when related to lineage.
- Think that the ends justify the means; that the world is inherently ugly, and engaging in its ugliness, while distasteful, is not inherently evil.

Your character may lean more towards the Followers if they:

- Believe that a significantly better world without the ugliness of ours is indeed possible. Followers-aligned individuals believe that significant, radical change is required to achieve this better world—and may involve reforming or tearing down certain long-standing institutions.
- Believe that most inequality and wealth disparity is the result of unfair systems, and rarely the fault of the individuals themselves suffering in poverty.
- Do not value tradition, religion, and honor as much as the majority of the population. This can be due to personal experience, or from scholarly research.
- Value empathy, understanding, and compassion—particularly towards those that afford that same sympathy to others in turn.
