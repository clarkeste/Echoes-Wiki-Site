The people of Hyrule do not tend to have the same names that we have. There are some guidelines to be kept in mind when making names:

- You probably wouldn’t find a person named your name idea on the street.
- It is either a fictional name, or an unusual real name (ie, Mina, Colter, Emerson, etc).
- It is not extremely complicated or difficult to pronounce (No “Arvargaraxthian”)
- Try to avoid having English words combine to make a name. “Steelward” is an awesome title, but it doesn’t really fit as a given name.
- It fits the fantasy setting. This is subjective, but so long as you follow the above criteria, it will usually fit. Consult with the GM for confirmation.

Here are some examples for names that fit for each of the starting [[Peoples]], and some general tips.

Oh, and if you want even more ideas, [visit this excellent name generator.](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/legend-of-zelda.php) Keep in mind that the “Blin” section seems to be designed for species names, and not individual [[Monsters|Monsters]], and is therefore not particularly applicable.

### Hylian

[[Hylians|Hylian]] names are versatile, so almost anything fantastical-sounding will fly. They tend to have slightly more fantastical names.

The following are example names, for inspiration. It is suggested that you avoid taking from them directly, as a lot of these names are from various minor [[NPCs]] across the Zelda series. However, that just means that they’re common first names, so at the same time, go for it if one of them really strikes your fancy.

### Zora

[[Zora]] names are fairly simple. Names tend to be 2 syllables long and usually start and end with either a vowel or a consonant. Some tend to be longer, though, especially names for female Zora. Many Zora names are oceanic or music-inspired. But, feel free to break the rules as much as you’d like!

### Gorons
[[Gorons|Goron]] names tend to be simple, but their names vary a lot in length. Most names sound “guttural” and reflect their rocky nature though, but there are of course exceptions. Some Goron names literally have ‘guron’ in the name, or allusions to it, like ‘Goro’. Plenty start with G.

### Gerudo
[[Gerudo]] names tend to be similar to Hylian names owing to their shared history. Gerudo names tend to differ in that they are a little more ‘foreign’ sounding, using sounds or letter combinations that are unusual in English.

The following are example names, for inspiration. It is suggested that you avoid taking from them directly, as a lot of these names are from various minor NPCs across the Zelda series. However, that just means that they’re common first names, so at the same time, go for it if one of them really strikes your fancy.

### Sheikah

### Monster Names
The names of [[Monsters]] tend to be harsh or esoteric, fitting with their often frightening and uncanny nature. Some others are simple, deceptively so. When making a monster name, feel free to be very creative and don’t worry if it sounds a little unusual.

The following are example names, for inspiration. It is suggested that you avoid taking from them directly, as a lot of these names are from various minor NPCs across the Zelda series.

### Foreign Human Names
Humans are a catch-all for humans that are not Hylian, Sheikah, or Gerudo. Their names tend to be simpler, more familiar to us, with many being “corrupted” (read: altered) versions of semi-common real names, that are pronounced similarly. Hyrulean human names are more north american, Labrynnan names more european/british, and Holodrumian names more japanese/korean.
