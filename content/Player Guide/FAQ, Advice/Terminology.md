There is some terminology used more often in Hyrule and the planet it resides on than in our own world and language. While you’ll likely pick up most of it while playing in [[Echoes of the Departed]], this acts as a quick-reference sheet if you care to take a look.

- Sorcerer and [[Spell Creation|Spellcaster]] are more used more often to describe someone who uses sorcery, as opposed to Wizard and Witch. The latter two are sometimes used, but rarely, and Witch is mostly used in a derogatory fashion. [[Prophecy|Seer and Fortune-Teller]] are also used in some cases.
- Sorcery and Spells are just as common as the word Magic; however, the word Magic is still used often, particularly as an adjective.


Our modern curse words are not used in Hyrule. Instead, various others are used.
- Abydocomist: a liar, untrustworthy, selfish person
- Ruffian: A brutish person of little intelligence
- By the Gods/By Hylia: An exclamation.
- Blunderboss: Derived from the name of a weapon in a popular fictional novel, it means somebody who is slow, clumsy and blundering.
- Hylia damn you/it: This one is likely self-explanatory.
- Confound It!: An exclamation of frustration or anger.
- Rusts!/Rusting: An exclamation or adjective.
- Scunner: Refers to a bad person, or immoral one.
- Blast it!: An exclamation of frustration or anger.
- Damn, Damnit: These are self-explanatory.
- Hell: This one is self-explanatory.


Additionally, adjectives like vile, pathetic and obstinate are used commonly. However, the most common type of insult in the world is usually not a particular word or phrase, but something that fits the situation. Such as “I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain that to you.” Or “You are the most obstinate, dense, and idiotic creature that has ever wandered into my woods, an abydocomist who simply assumes their stupid, violent, vile interpretation is correct, a lubberwort with far too much influence, not even clean enough to spit on, you foolish blunderboss who enacts your violent cow-handed schemes while pretending it is some sort of favor! You are a ruffian and I demand you cease at once.”


Some animals have far more common names in Echoes of the Departed.
- The Bats in Hyrule are often called Keese, and is the name of their subspecies
- Animated skeletons and bones are called Stalfos
- ‘Ghosts’ are usually referred to as phantoms or echoes. Actual ghosts that interact with the world are called Poes.
- While mummified is a word, Gibdo is usually used instead of ‘mummy’.
- Cyclop is not a used word. Instead, the point of reference for a one-eyed creature is the Hinox.
