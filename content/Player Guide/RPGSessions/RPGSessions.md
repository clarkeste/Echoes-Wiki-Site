#### Getting started with RPGSessions
First, go to [this link.](https://firstlook.rpgsessions.com/auth/login?redirect=/library/explorer) If you are already signed into RPGSessions, it should take to your library, in which case you should follow the next section of the guide.

For others, it will redirect you to a login page. Here, hit 'Register' at the bottom-left of the panel. Then, create your own account by filling out your Username, Email, and Password.

Once that is done, congratulations! You are signed in.

#### Connect your Discord, and Proper Settings
There are some settings that should be selected for the best experience in Echoes of the Departed, as well as a Discord integration system that will make everything far more convenient.

First, navigate to the Profile tab in the top-right of the main screen where you will be when opening the site.

Make sure ‘Dice Type’ is set to [[Genesys]]. If it is not, click on it and change it.

Then, on the left side of the screen, it will show you an option to link your Discord account. Hit the “Link Account” button, and accept the confirmation in the new Discord Tab. Now, any servers you are in with RPGSessions games will appear in the Games tab.
