The Game Table is the center of the game, on the [[RPGSessions]] website. While most of its functions can be achieved using the [[RPGSessions Bot]], using the Game Table offers both integration with the server and an intuitive GUI.

To find the Game Table, look at the tabs at the top-right of the website. Select ‘Games’.

After changing to the Game Tab, the currently active games will appear. If you are in a Discord server that is linked to a currently running Game Table, it should automatically appear.

Select ‘Open Game’ to enter the Game Table.

Now, you’re inside the Game Table! You can do various actions, such as rolling [[Initiative]], rolling for [[Sacred Points]], rolling [[Skill Checks]], or viewing your [[Character Sheet]].
