Modifiers are a feature on RPGSessions that allows [[Weapons]], [[Items]], [[Talents]], or [[Armor]] to influence other stats on the character sheet. This is useful for automating passive and consistent [[Qualities]] and Talent effects.

##### Adding Modifiers to Items and Talents
Modifiers can be added to Weapons. These are done to denote or automate one of the Modifiers listed on the corresponding page, such as [[Accurate (Passive) (Quality)|Accurate]] or [[Quick Charge (Passive) (Quality)|Quick Charge]].

It should be noted that Modifiers are only active if the the Item it is attached to is “Equipped”. This is not true for Talents, who have any Modifiers attached to them active at all times.

To add a Modifier, hit the “Add Quality” or “Add Modifier” button when editing or creating an Item or Talent. In this example, the Weapon section is used.

Options will pop up asking you to decide what type of Modifier you would like to select for your new Modifier.

In order of left-to-right and top-to-bottom:
- Armor: Allows you to change the values of a piece of armor when the Modifier is active.
- Attribute: Allows you to change a variety of [[Derived Attributes]], as well as misc ones, when the Modifier is active. This is relevant when adding, for example, a Talent such as [[Enduring]] or [[Toughened]] that increases your [[Soak]] or [[Wound Threshold]] respectively.
- Characteristic: Allows you to change the value of [[Characteristics]] when this Modifier is active. This is relevant when adding, for example, a Talent such as [[Dedication]].
- Skill: Allows you to add Dice or symbols to all rolls with any given [[Skills]] when this Modifier is active. This is relevant when adding, for example, Talents that remove [[Setback Dice]] or add [[Boost Dice]]; such as Knack For It.
- Weapon: Allows you to modify a variety of a Weapon’s parameters, such as [[Damage]], [[Critical Rating]], and allows you to add extra dice. This is relevant when adding, for example, the Accurate or [[Superior (Passive) (Quality)|Superior]] Qualities.
- Text Only: This is the go-to Modifier category, and is used for any Modifier that is situational. This is relevant when adding, for example, [[Quick Charge (Passive) (Quality)|Quick Charge,]] [[Sacred Luster (Passive) (Quality)|Sacred Luster]], [[Jump Slash]], [[Knockdown (Active) (Quality)|Knockdown]], [[Ensnare (Active) (Quality)|Ensnare]], [[Challenge!]], or many more Qualities and Talents.

Be careful to when adding Modifiers that are supposed to activate situationally as any type of Modifier besides Text Only. The issue here is that aside from checking whether an Item is Equipped, a Modifier will always be active no matter what, meaning its situationality is lost.

Since Talents are already just text, it is suggested that–instead of creating a Text Only Modifier–that the effect, usually already listed in its explanation, be simply a part of the Talent’s description.
