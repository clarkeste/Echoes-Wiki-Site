**Tier:** 4
**Activation:** Active (Action)
**Ranked:** No

Once per [[Adventure]], your [[Character]] may use this [[Talents|Talent]] to make a **[[Difficulty|Hard]]** (3p) **[[Perception|Perception]] [[Skill Checks|Check]]** while contemplating a mystery, or factual uncertainty. If they succeed, they identify all related facts that they could possibly know, based on various details they noticed, and discover an accurate answer. While they could miss out on details, the final answer will be truthful. This could include a suspect's characteristics (but likely not their identity) from a crime scene, the abilities or capabilities of a Character based on documents and personal observations, an Encounter plan or scheme of an [[Adversary|enemy]] group from overheard mutterings and situational evidence, or an elaborate scheme as it unfolds from various bits of evidence. Your character may identify all this, and additional related situations or facts per additional [[Success|Success]].

In some situations, [[The GM]] may decide that your Character does not know enough or has experienced enough to get a satisfactory answer. They will tell you this before you attempt a Check, and it will not consume your use for the Adventure.
