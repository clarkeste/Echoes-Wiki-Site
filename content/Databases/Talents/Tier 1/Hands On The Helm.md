Once per Round while helming a [[Ship Combat|Ship]], your [[Character|Character]] may use this [[Talents|Talent]] to increase or decrease its Speed by 1 as an [[Incidentals|Incidental]], to a minimum of 0 or a maximum of the Ship’s max speed. This is in addition to the use of the Accelerate or Decelerate [[Maneuvers]], and does not incur additional [[Strain]].
