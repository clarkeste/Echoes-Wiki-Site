**Tier:** 1
**Activation:** Active (Action)
**Ranked:** No

When making a [[Knowledge Skills|Knowledge]] [[Skill Checks|Skill Check]], your [[Character]] can instead use this [[Talents|Talent]] to spend an amount of Rupees equal to fifty times the [[Difficulty]] of the Check and automatically succeed on the Knowledge Check with one uncanceled [[Success]] (instead of rolling). At your [[The GM|GM]]'s discretion, your Character may not be able to use Bought Info if the information is particularly sensitive or difficult to find, or buying it doesn't make narrative sense.
