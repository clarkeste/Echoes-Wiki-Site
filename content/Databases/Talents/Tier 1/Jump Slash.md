**Tier:** 1
**Activation:** Active (Action)
**Ranked:** No

When within [[Short Range]] of a target while wielding a Melee [[Weapons|Weapon]], may take the Jump Slash [[Actions|Action]]. The active [[Character]] immediately jumps into [[Engaged Range]] of the target without the need of a [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]], and then rolls an [[Attack Check]] as per usual. Until the beginning of the Characterâ€™s next turn, if any [[Adversary]] attacks them besides the target of the Jump Slash, that enemy benefits from the [[Flanking]] Modifier.
