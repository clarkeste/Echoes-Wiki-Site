When you take this [[Talents|Talent]], your [[Character|Character]] gains one [[Knowledge Skills|Knowledge Skill]] (of your choice) as a [[Career Skills|Career Skill]]. In addition, once per [[Adventure]], your Character may collect a small favor from a member of an institute of higher learning if they could justifiably know you personally or by reputation, even if they do not already owe your Character a favor.
