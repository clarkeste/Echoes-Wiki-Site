**Tier:** 1 
**Activation:** Active (Action) 
**Ranked:** No 

Once per Round, your [[Character]] may use this [[Talents|Talent]] to perform a [[Ranged]] or [[Gunnery]] [[Attack Check]] against one eligible and personal-scale or [[Ship Combat|ship-scale]] target. If the Check is successful, halve the [[Damage|Damage]] inflicted by the Attack (before reducing Damage by the target’s [[Soak]]). The target is [[Immobilized]] until the end of their next turn. If the Target is a vehicle, its maximum Speed is instead decreased by 1 until the end of their next turn.
