When you take this [[Talents|Talent]], your [[Character]] gains [[Coordination|Coordination]], [[Operating|Operating]], or [[Resilience|Resilience]] (your choice) as a [[Career Skills|Career Skill]] due to their history or current membership in one of the Guilds. In addition, once per [[Adventure]], your Character may collect a small favor from a member of a major Guild if they could justifiably know you personally or by reputation, even if they do not already owe your Character a favor.
