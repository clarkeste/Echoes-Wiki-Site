When [[Engaged Range|Engaged]] with an [[Adversary]] that is [[Staggered]], [[Disoriented]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Oppressed]], may take the Helm Splitter [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]]. Jump over the enemy and land on the other side, dealing [[Damage]] equal to your [[Weapons|Weapon's]] [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]], if your Character has a Melee weapon.
