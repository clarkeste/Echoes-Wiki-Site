Your [[Character]] may use this [[Talents|Talent]] to make an [[Difficulty|Average]] (2p) [[Leadership]] [[Skill Checks|Check]]. If successful, a number of allies equal to your Characterâ€™s [[Presence]] may immediately suffer 1 [[Strain]] to perform one [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] (out of turn). If there are any questions as to which allies take their Maneuvers first, your Character is the final arbiter. If a [[Player|Player]] is not available to take their Maneuver, they may take it as a second or third Maneuver on their turn.
