Once per [[Encounter]], if the [[Adversary|enemy]] is [[Prone]] and is either a [[Adversary#Rivals|rival]], [[Adversary#Minions|minion]], or the difference between their current [[Wounds]] and [[Wound Threshold]] is less than the [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]] of your [[Weapons|Weapon]], you may take a Fatal Blow [[Maneuvers|Maneuver]] so long as you are holding a melee Weapon and are within [[Short Range]]. This Maneuver applies the Base Damage of the Weapon, and applies a +20 [[Critical Injury]] to the targeted enemy in addition to any other modifiers. When using Fatal Blow, the [[Character]] enters [[Engaged Range|Engaged]] Range with the target.
