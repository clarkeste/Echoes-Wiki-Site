**Tier:** 3
**Activation:** Active (Incidental, Out of Turn) 
**Ranked:** No 

Your [[Character]] must have purchased the [[Echoes of the Departed/Wiki Stuff/Game Wiki/Databases/Talents/Tier 1/Parry|Parry Talent]] to benefit from this [[Talents|Talent]]. When your Character suffers a hit from a melee [[Attack Check]] and uses Parry to reduce the [[Damage]] from that hit, after the Attack is resolved, you may spend a [[Despair]] or three [[Threat]] from the attacker’s Check to use this Talent. Then, your Character automatically hits the attacker once with a [[Brawl|Brawl]] or Melee [[Weapons|Weapon]] your Character is wielding. The hit deals the Weapon’s [[Damage#Base Damage|Base Damage]], plus any Damage from applicable Talents or abilities. Your Character can’t use this talent if the original attack [[Incapacitated|incapacitates]] them.
