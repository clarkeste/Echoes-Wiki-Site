**Tier:** 3
**Activation:** Active (Action)
**Ranked:** No

Your [[Character]] must have purchased the [[Hard-Headed]] [[Talents|Talent]] to benefit from this Talent. Your Character may use the Hard-Headed Talent to recover from being [[Incapacitated]] due to exceeding their [[Strain Threshold]]. On their next turn after having become Incapacitated, they may make a [[Difficulty|Formidable]] (5p) [[Resilience|Resilience]] [[Skill Checks|Check]], even though an incapacitated Character is normally unable to perform [[Actions]]. If they succeed, they decrease their [[Strain]] to one less that their Strain Threshold. The [[Difficulty]] of this Check decreases by per additional rank of Hard-Headed, to a minimum of [[Difficulty|Easy]] (1p).
