**Ranked:** No

Once per [[Encounter]], your [[Character]] may use this talent to make an [[Opposed Check|Opposed]] [[Charm]] or [[Coercion]] versus [[Discipline]] Check targeting one Character within [[Medium Range]] (or within earshot). If successful, the target suffers [[Strain]] equal to twice your Character's [[Presence]], plus one additional Strain per [[Success]]. Your Character heals Dtrain equal to the Dtrain inflicted. If [[Incapacitated]] due to this Talent, the target could flee the scene in shame, collapse in a dejected heap, or throw themself at your character in fury, depending on your [[The GM|GM]] and the nature of your Character's witty barbs.
