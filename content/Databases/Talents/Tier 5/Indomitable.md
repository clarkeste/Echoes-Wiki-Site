**Tier:** 5
**Activation:** Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
**Ranked:** No

Once per [[Encounter]], when your [[Character]] would be [[Incapacitated]] due to exceeding their [[Wound Threshold|Wound]] or [[Strain Threshold]], you may spend a [[Sacred Points|Sacred Point]] to use this [[Talents|Talent]]. Then, your Character is not Incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your Character reduces their [[Strain]] or [[Wounds]] to below their Threshold before the end of their next turn, they are not incapacitated.
