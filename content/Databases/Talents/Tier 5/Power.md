May use [[Melee-Heavy]] Weapons single-handed. If your Character is holding anything [[Combat]]-related in the other hand, even if it is not being used, increase the [[Difficulty]] by one. This is in addition to the Duel-Wielding effects. Additionally, once per [[Encounter]], after rolling an [[Attack Check]], may suffer 6 Strain to add the [[Breach (Modifier)|Breach]] 1 and [[Knockdown (Active) (Quality)|Knockdown Quality]].

Purchasing this [[Talents|Talent]] permanently increases your [[Virtues|Points in Power]] by 1.
