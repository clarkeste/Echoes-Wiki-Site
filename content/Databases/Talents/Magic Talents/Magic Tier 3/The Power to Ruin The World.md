May add the “Power to Ruin The World” (10MP) [[Modifiers|Modifier]] when using the [[Endow|Endow]] [[Spell Creation#Base Powers|Base Power]], to utter a negative curse that can only be broken with a holy [[Items|Item]], such as a piece of the Triforce, the Master Sword, the Four Sword, or a pearl of the Goddesses. Uttering this curse causes the [[Character]] who casted it to immediately suffer a +150 [[Critical Injury]].

Be careful. There may be consequences for learning this dark art…
