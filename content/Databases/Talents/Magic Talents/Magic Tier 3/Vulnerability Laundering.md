**Tier:** 3
**Activation:** Active
**Ranked:** No

May add the “Vulnerability Laundering” [[Modifiers|Modifier]] (5MP cost) when using a [[Spell Creation|Spell]] using [[Invoke]]. On a Successful [[Skill Checks|Check]], create between 1-3 ‘weak points’. These weak points can be on an individual’s body, requiring the use of a [[Maneuvers#Called Shot|Called Shot Maneuver]], or can be separate and use one Maneuver on their owner’s turn. Increase your [[Character]]’s [[Soak]] by twice the amount of active ‘weak points’, and suffer an amount of Strain equal to their amount at the beginning of every one of your turns. These points can be destroyed by a successful [[Attack Check]]. Vulnerability Laundering can only be used once per [[Encounter]].
