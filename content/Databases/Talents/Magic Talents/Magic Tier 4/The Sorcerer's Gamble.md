Once per [[Encounter]], when making a [[Spell Creation|Magic]] [[Attack Check]], may pick a [[Qualities|Quality]] that imparts a [[Status Effects|Status Effect]] on the [[Spell Creation|Spell]] and increase the [[Difficulty]] by two. If it is successful and the chosen [[Qualities|Quality]] is activated, double the amount of rounds which that [[Qualities|Quality]] applies for.
