When using [[Endow]], may use the Flight [[Modifiers|Modifier]] (14MP cost) to bless a target with the ability to fly. Flying will often require [[Coordination|Coordination]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] to manage the flight. This is separate from hovering in that the [[Character]] has much more control and can go quicker.
