When your [[Character]] casts a [[Spell Creation|Spell]], they may use this [[Talents|Talent]] to consume a physical [[Items|Item]] and add a [[Boost Dice|Boost Die]] to the [[Skill Checks|Check]]. The Item does not have to be expensive or rare, but it does have to be thematically appropriate for the Spell, available to your Character, and subject to your [[The GM|GM]]'s approval. Some examples include a match or bit of sulphur for an [[Attack Spell]] with the [[Burn (Modifier)|Burn]] Modifier, a piece of shattered glass for a [[Prophecy]] Spell, or a scrap of bandage for a [[Life]] Spell.
