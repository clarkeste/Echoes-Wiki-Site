Make a [[Difficulty|Hard]] (3p) [[Force|Force]] [[Skill Checks|Check]] in a particular location. If successful, your [[Character]] is now ‘linked’ to that location, and will be able to feel supernaturally if it’s in danger, if there are intruders, or any other such dangers, regardless of distance. The location is also designed to be manipulatable magically by your Character, with effects and explanations agreed on between you and [[The GM|the GM]]. Only one location at a time can benefit from this effect, and changing is often difficult.
