**Tier:** 2
**Activation:** Passive
**Ranked:** Yes

When purchasing a rank in this [[Talents|Talent]], pick one [[Modifiers|Modifier]] used in [[Spell Creation]]. That Modifier now costs -1 Magic Point, to a minimum of 1. If a Modifier has a cost of 1 by default, add an additional free rank whenever it is added to a Spell. Each additional rank in If All Else Fails allows a [[Character]] to add another Modifier discount, including to the same Modifier, if the cost of the Modifier is not already 1.
