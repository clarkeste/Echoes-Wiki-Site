This is the Home Page for the [[Echoes of the Departed]] Wiki!

If you’re looking for how to get started in playing the game, then you’re in the right place. This article will point you in the direction of various different articles that include important information for playing the game.

### 1: Skill Checks
Skill Checks are the foundation of [[Genesys]], and most [[TTRPGs]]. It is when your PC/Character rolls, using one of their Skills, to determine if they succeed in a task or not. 

Read the [[Skill Checks|Skill Checks article here]]. Don’t get too much into the weeds on the Narrative Dice system just yet—we’ll explain that next.

### 2: Narrative Dice
Narrative Dice are an integral part of what makes Genesys different from other TTRPGs. It allows each check to have dozens of different possible outcomes, depending on a different combination of symbols that produce additional beneficial effects, or drawbacks as a result of a check.

Think of it as the improv principle of responding with “No, but" or “Yes, and” codified into a game mechanic. Or like Natural 20s in D&D, but so much more dynamic, narratively interesting, and tactical.

### 3: Combat Scenarios
Combat is not uncommon in the cruel reality of a country at war with itself. [[Social Checks|While there are many ways to attempt to avoid it]], turn-based Combat is still an extremely important part of Echoes of the Departed. 

The game has a focus on providing interesting tactical situations in Combat, particularly when it comes to positioning in Genesys. Likewise, Combat is designed to be far more streamlined than D&D, with a focus on the fun parts.

### 4: Character Creation
To interact with the world, a [[Player]] needs a [[Character|Character]]. A Character is a vessel for the story that the Player sees and influences, and just like a character in a book or movie, should have depth, motivations, flaws and goals. A Character also has Skills and other stats that are used to interact with the world.
